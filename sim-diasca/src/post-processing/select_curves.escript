% Adapted from time_series_analyzer_test.erl.


% The relative paths to find BEAM *and* header files are a bit of a mess: the
% script will fail if not run directly from the directory it is in.

% For app_start (relies on the -pa setting for traces):
-include_lib("src/traces_for_apps.hrl").


% Allows to select a subset of the curves in the specifed time-series.
