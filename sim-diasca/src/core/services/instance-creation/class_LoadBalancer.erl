% Implementation notes.



% Load balancer placement.

% It used to be placed on any node, yet then the initialisation files had to be
% included in the simulation archive, which was becoming too large and too long
% to create. So now the load balancer is always running on the user host, and
% thus can access directly to initialisation files.



% Actor identifier section.

% An actor identifier is a reproducible, abstract (non technically-dependent)
% identifier of a simulation actor, a.k.a. AAI, for 'Abstract Actor Identifier'.
%
% It is a strictly positive integer, starting at 1 and incremented by the load
% balancer each time that it creates an actor.
%
% During a simulation, there is a bijection between actor identifiers and the
% PID of their corresponding Erlang processes.
%
% From a simulation to another, actor PIDs will most probably change (ex: if the
% number of computing nodes varies, or if the placement policy in use takes
% dynamically into account the load of the computers), but a given actor should
% always have the same actor identifier assigned to it.


% The load balancer has no real life of its own, it is mainly triggered whenever
% an actor is to be created, as a result it can remain mostly passive.


% Previously the load balancer had to send information about created actor
% instances to the relevant instance tracker and to maintain a node-based
% tracker look-up table to target the right one.
%
% The load balancer does not communicate anymore with an instance tracker, as it
% could not manage at least one useful actor-level information: the name of that
% actor. Thus each actor had, one way or another, to update anyway a tracker
% with its name (preferentially when subscribing to its time manager).
%
% Having to send its name, the actor can go a little further and provide all the
% information needed at once (ex: classname), and the load balancer does not
% need anymore to be involved there, simplifying the overall applicative
% protocol.


% Previously the seeding of each actor was done by its local time manager. Now,
% as anyway the load balancer is able to send information to each actor when
% creating it (ex: its AAI), its seed is specified as well, and thus managed by
% the load balancer.
%
% This design is simpler, and easily allows for a seeding that does not depend
% on the number of available computing nodes, as it is centralised by the
% load-balancer (instead of being distributed among time managers, which would
% make the outcome of the simulations depend on the number of involved computing
% hosts).
%
% Hence, to any actor / AAI, a unique, reproducible seed must correspond. This
% is an issue when loading instances from file, as they are presented to the
% load balancer in any order (due to the parallel processing of the creation
% lines that such files comprise). As a result, the loader balancer must
% maintain a table of pre-generated random seeds, indexed by the corresponding
% AAI. As this table may grow and shrink (depending on the order of the actor
% presentations), a table is more convenient (see seed_table).


% The load balancer is both a simulation agent and an actor; this requires, in
% some cases, extra care (ex: when deserialising a simulation, or when stopping
% it).



% Regarding initialisation:
%
% Creating instances before the simulation starts can be done either
% programmatically (typically directly from the simulation case, from the method
% of a scenario, etc.) or based on data (typically from a set of initialisation
% streams, or corresponding files).
%
% The 'base_actor_identifier' attribute is set depending on these modes,
% respectively to 'undefined' or to the value at which the
% 'next_actor_identifier' attribute was set when switching from code-based (the
% default) to stream-based initialisation: the AAI assigned to instances read
% from file then increment from base_actor_identifier onward, based on the line
% number of their definition in the read file. As not all lines of these files
% correspond to creation requests (ex: blank lines or comments), some AAIs may
% never be assigned (that is not a problem).


% Regarding instance creation:
%
% It is now managed asynchronously internally (yet still synchronously in terms
% of API), to allow for nested creations (actors that create actors from their
% constructor). So now the load balancer should be interacted with thanks to
% oneway messages only, and it has to track the spawn initiators so that, when a
% created instance reports that it is ready, the load balancer can notify its
% initiator.
%
% As single or multiple creations can be requested, the load-balancer stores two
% tables:
%
% - spawn_table, which can convert the PID of a spawned actor (its keys) into
% the PID of the corresponding initiator (the associated value), to find the
% relevant initiator (typically the simulation case itself for initial
% creations, and an actor for runtime creations) when a spawn_successful is
% received
%
% - initiator_requests, used in order to be able to report to an initiator the
% PID of the spawned actor(s) it requested; so this table can convert a PID of
% an initiator into a list of:
%
%  * either a single PID, the spawned one, to know it was a single-spawn
%  request, and thus that the initiator can be directly notified
%
%  * or pairs of two lists of PIDs; the first is the original, full, ordered
%  list of the created PIDs immediately returned at spawn time; the second
%  begins as an exact copy of it, yet each time a spawn success is reported, the
%  corresponding PID is removed from it; when this list becomes empty, then the
%  previous one can be returned to the initiator, as it contains by design the
%  right PIDs in the right order
%
% For runtime creations, a per-creation tag can be specified; it allows avoiding
% the sending back of the construction parameters, which can be of a larger
% size. As initial creations are usually synchronously managed and anyway are
% in-order, no specific tag applies.
%

% Creating actors (ex: A2, A3) from constructors (ex: from the one of A1) cannot
% be done, as A1 is by design not synchronised yet to the simulation (hence it
% cannot send an actor message to the load balancer for that).
%
% If, in the future, this was allowed, then the 3 following paragraphs would
% apply:

% Creating actors (say, A2 and A3) from any actor oneway (including
% onFirstDiasca/2) of an actor (say, A1) means that, when the first actor, A1,
% is requested to be created by A0 thanks to class_Actor:create_actor/3 (A0
% sending a createRuntime actor message to the load balancer),
% createRuntime/{4,5} *must not return* until A1 and thus any nested actors it
% created from its constructors (A2, A3, etc.) are successfully spawned.
%
% Indeed, if createRuntime/{4,5} was not blocking, then the load balancer would
% notify immediately after it triggered the spawn of A1 that its diasca ended,
% and from then the simulation would progress arbitrarily until the
% corresponding spawn_successful message(s) are received, thus too late.
%
% So the createRuntime variations (with or without tag, placed or not) override
% the main loop of the load balancer, to serve creation requests and spawn
% notifications, blocking until A1 finally reached the end of its constructor
% and thus reported that its spawn succeeded.

% Constructs a new load balancer, from following parameters:
%
% - PlacementPolicy describes which heuristic should be used in order to
% dispatch created actors onto computing nodes; following placement policies are
% specified (only the first one is implemented):
%
%  - round_robin: one of the simplest scheduling algorithms, which assigns
%  actors to computing nodes in equal portions and in order, handling all
%  creation requests without enforcing a specific priority; round-robin
%  scheduling is both simple and easy to implement, and starvation-free; it
%  relies on the statistical hypothesis that all actors consume on average a
%  similar amount of resource and that all computing nodes provide on average a
%  similar amount of resource as well; see also:
%  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling
%
%  - select_least_loaded_first: the load balancer will evaluate the current load
%  of the computing nodes, and then will choose create any new actor on the
%  least loaded node (not implemented yet; timing effects and load variations
%  might make it tricky or even instable)
%
% - Nodes :: [ atom_node_name() ] is a list of Erlang nodes (as atoms)
% that are to take part to the simulation, i.e. that are eligible as running
% environments for actors
%
% - NodeAvailabilityTolerance can be:
%
%  - fail_on_unavailable_node: the construction of the load balancer will fail
%  if at least one of the specified nodes is not available
%
%  - allow_unavailable_nodes: all nodes found not available will be rejected,
%  and the simulation will rely only on the remaining ones
%
% - EvaluationMode :: evaluation_requested_properties() provides the load
% balancer with all information to properly seed each actor
%
% - TroubleshootingMode :: boolean() tells whether the troubleshooting mode is
% activated
%
% - InitialisationFiles :: [ file_path() ] is a list of initialisation files,
% from which initial instances will be created
%
% A node might be unavailable because its host is unavailable, or because the
% node cannot be run on its available host.
%
% A load balancer is also an actor (to create reproducibly other actors), and
% thus is linked to a time manager. As the load balancer is by default created
% on the same node as the root time manager, its time manager is the root one.
