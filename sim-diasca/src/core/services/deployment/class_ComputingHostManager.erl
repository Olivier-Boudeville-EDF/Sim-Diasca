% Implementation notes.


% If connecting from X@a to Y@b, the connection may fail or wait for a user
% input (ex: modal window popped through SSH ask pass, if password-less
% authentication failed) and thus stay stuck in system_utils:run_command/1,
% indefinitively or long enough to be rejected (no way of stopping this command
% by message or time-out).

% As a series of potentially lenghty blocking operations are performed here, we
% try not to communicate with the deployment manager once we are already past
% the deployment time-out, as we do not want to interact with it whereas there
% is a 'delete' message already waiting for this manager to be read: the
% deployment manager would then not expect to receive such messages, having gone
% through the next steps.

% To start a remote node (via SSH), instead of using system_utils:run_command/1,
% a slave node could be used, see:
% support.process-one.net/doc/display/ERL/Starting+a+set+of+Erlang+cluster+nodes
%
% However using system_utils:run_command/1 seems to work great, and relying on a
% slave node seems to imply some consequences that may not be wanted, as
% discussed in: http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/slave.html. For example:
%
% - all TTY output produced at the slave will be sent back to the master node
%
% - file I/O is done via the master
%
% - the slave node should use the same file system at the master; at least,
% Erlang/OTP should be installed in the same place on both computers and the
% same version of Erlang should be used


% A problem with code_loader may happen due to the boot sequence of an Erlang
% node. Basically, net_adm:ping may reply positively *before* the code server
% can accept requests.





% @doc Constructs a new manager for a given computing host.
%
% Construction parameters:
%
% - HostnameOptions={Hostname, Username}, Hostname being either the name (as a
% plain string) of the remote computing host to manage, or the 'localhost' atom,
% Username being the name of the user to rely on for that host
%
% - NodeOptions={NodeBaseName, NodeNamingNode, NodeCleanupWanted, NodeCookie,
% NodeSchedulerCount}, a 5-tuple made of:
%
%  - NodeName, the base node name (a plain string, ex: "my_node"), without any
%   host name
%
%   - NodeNamingNode, a node naming mode (i.e. short or long names)
%
%   - NodeCleanupWanted, which tells whether an initial clean-up of any
%   previously existing node with that name is wanted: it is either false, or
%   the full path of the clean-up script to be used, as a binary (note: this
%   path must have been already validated once for all by the caller, it is
%   considered here as reliable)
%
%   - NodeCookie, the cookie that must be used to launch any new node
%
%   - NodeSchedulerCount :: maybe( count() ) the number of
%   schedulers to create on the associated node
%
% - NetworkOptions={EpmdPort, TCPPortRestriction}, a pair made of:
%
%   - EpmdPort is the EPMD port specification, with can be either the
%   'undefined' atom or the port number; note that if a non-default EPMD port is
%   specified for a new node, this implies that the current node usually has to
%   itself respect the same non-standard convention (ex: see the FIREWALL_OPT
%   make option in myriad/GNUmakevars.inc), otherwise available nodes will not
%   be found
%
%   - TCPPortRestriction is the TCP port restriction, with can be either the
%   'no_restriction' atom or a pair of integers {MinTCPPort,MaxTCPPort}; note
%   that if using a specific TCP/IP port range for a new node, the current node
%   may have to respect this constraint as well (see the FIREWALL_OPT make
%   option in myriad/GNUmakevars.inc), otherwise inter-node communication could
%   fail
%
% - DeployOptions is a {DeploymentManagerPid, DeployTimeOut,
%   InterNodeTickTimeOut, AdditionalBEAMDirs} tuple, where:
%
%   - DeploymentManagerPid: the PID of the deployment manager, which created
%   this manager, in order to be able to interact with it later
%
%   - DeployTimeOut is the maximum number of milliseconds which will be left to
%   this host to be deployed
%
%   - InterNodeTickTimeOut is the time-out for inter-node ticks, to be
%   transmitted to the deployment agent later
%
%   - BinDeployBaseDir is the deployment base directory (as a binary)
%
%   - AdditionalBEAMBinDirs is a list of directories (as binaries) containing
%   BEAM files that shall be added to the code path of each computing node
%
%   - SII is the identifier of the current simulation
