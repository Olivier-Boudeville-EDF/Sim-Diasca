% @doc Base class for <n>broadcasting actors</b>, which are actors that may have
% to send the same actor message to a large number (e.g. at least several
% thousands) of actors.
%
-module(class_BroadcastingActor).


-define( class_description,
		 "Broadcasting actor base class."
		 "This is a specialisation of the generic actor class, for all models "
		 "that have at least once to send the same actor message to a large "
		 "number (e.g. at least several thousands) of actors."
		 "This broadcasting actor manages its waited actors thanks to a table "
		 "rather than thanks to a plain list, which should be more efficient "
		 "for larger simulations."
		 "If applicable, for larger numbers of actors, the sendings might "
		 "be done over more than one diasca. See the load balancer as a "
		 "typical example of that."
		 "Note: one must ensure that a broadcasting actor sends messages "
		 "with its own send_actor_message/3 and send_actor_messages/3 "
		 "static methods rather than the ones of class_Actor."
		 "See also class_Actor.erl" ).



% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).



% Tne class-specific attributes of a broadcasting actor are:
-define( class_attributes, [

	{ waited_acks, actor_table(), "inherited from class_Actor, but with a "
	  "different type; it is now a table whose keys are the PIDs of the "
	  "actors to which this actor sent at least an actor message this diasca, "
	  "and whose associated values are the actual count of these sendings; it "
	  "allows a broadcasting actor to notify adequately its time manager that "
	  "its diasca is finished indeed, for actors sending a large number of "
	  "actor messages (e.g. the load balancer sending the onFirstDiasca "
	  "message to all actors)" },

	{ chunk_size, actor_count(), "the number of actors per sending chunk" } ] ).



% Usage notes:
%
% Sending a given actor message to actors across diascas may have consequences,
% notably if these actors interact, as of course they will process this message
% at different diascas. Watch out your actor interaction protocol!



% Helper functions.


% Helpers for scheduling, message sending, creation, etc.:
-export([ send_actor_message/3, send_actor_messages/3,
		  send_actor_messages_over_diascas/3 ]).



% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Actor.BroadcastingActor" ).


% For time_manager_name, virtual_seconds, etc.:
-include("class_TimeManager.hrl").

% For WOOPER, actor types, etc.:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").



% Shorthands:

-type tick_offset() :: class_TimeManager:tick_offset().
-type diasca() :: class_TimeManager:diasca().

-type actor_table() :: table( actor_pid(), class_Actor:actor_count() ).



% Implementation notes:
%
% A broadcasting actor is basically an actor whose waited_acks attribute changed
% from [ actor_pid() ] to actor_table() where, to an actor PID, the number of
% times this actor is waited for is associated.
%
% As a (broadcasting) actor may send more than one message to another actor at
% the same diasca (e.g. the load-balancer may notify a creating actor of
% multiple creations that happen at the same diasca), a count must be
% maintained.
%
% This choice cannot be generalised to all actors, as it would induce overhead
% in terms of processing and memory to the vast majority of them; hence the
% subclass defined here.

% Note that any update to class_Actor shall probably be propagated here as well.



-compile({ inline, [ get_trace_timestamp/3 ] } ).

% For silencing conditionally-unused functions:
-compile({ nowarn_unused_function, [ get_trace_timestamp/3 ] }).


% @doc Returns a rather detailed (hence more expensive) timestamp to be included
% in traces.
%
% Meant to be inlined as much as possible to lessen the cost of such traces.
%
% Note: directly deriving from class_Actor counterpart system.

		calendar:gregorian_seconds_to_datetime( round( CurrentSecond ) ),

	% Cannot include a newline as it would break the trace format:
	text_utils:format( "~ts {~B,~B}",
		[ time_utils:get_textual_timestamp( Timestamp ), TickOffset, Diasca ] ).



% @doc Constructs a broadcasting actor:
%
% - ActorSettings describes the actor abstract identifier (AAI) and seed of this
% actor, as assigned by the load balancer
%
% - ActorName is a human-readable name for that actor (as a plain string); it is
% preferably not too long and without whitespaces

% @doc Sends specified message to the specified actor, records this sending to

%
% An actor message parameter describes the behaviour (actor oneway, translating
% to an Erlang function) to trigger when this message will be taken into account
% by the targeted actor, once messages will have been properly reordered.
%
% This sent message corresponds to a oneway, not a request, to avoid any
% blocking operation, as the time management service must be the only one to
% control the course of the simulation.
%
% The sender PID is automatically added, thus it does not need to be specified
% explicitly here. The sender AAI is also automatically added as well, as the
% receiver will need it to reorder its incoming actor messages.
%
% The specified tick is the one expected for the delivery, i.e. the next tick,
% hence the +1.
%
% The actor message is a oneway call: it is described by the name of the actor
% oneway to trigger on the target actor (specified as an atom, e.g. 'setColor')
% on the next tick, and by a (possibly empty) list of the corresponding
% arguments; so the call is either 'my_oneway' or

%
% In all cases, the actual call, in the case of an actor message, will be
% performed with an additional parameter, the PID of the sending actor. This
% extra parameter will be transparently added, so an actor oneway which looks
% like a call to a oneway with N parameters specified will trigger a call to a
% function whose arity is N+2: the state, then the N parameters, then the PID of
