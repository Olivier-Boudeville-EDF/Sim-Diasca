% @doc Class implementing the <b>entry point of an experiment</b>, in charge of
% feeding and triggering an associated dataflow.
%
-module(class_ExperimentEntryPoint).


-define( class_description,
		 "The experiment entry point is a singleton instance in charge of "
		 "being the (logical) starting point that impulses the evaluation of "
		 "the registered dataflows, possibly at each timestep; technically it "
		 "is run in second position during a tick, just after the experiment "
		 "exit point that triggers it." ).


% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).


% Design notes:
%
% The Experiment Entry Point knows the various dataflows involved, which is
% useful whenever having to create, update, delete, etc. dataflow blocks (which
% each pertains to a given dataflow).
%
% This (experiment) entry point knows the experiment manager (as it may have to
% perform experiment-level operations) but also the world manager (as it may
% typically impulse changes in the simulation world).


% Please refer to the 'Dataflow Entry & Exit Points' and 'Scheduling Cycle of
% Experiments' sections of the Dataflow HOWTO in order to understand why this
% actor is purely passive and (only) triggered by its ExperimentExitPoint
% counterpart actor.



% The attributes that are specific to the experiment entry point are:
-define( class_attributes, [

	{ experiment_manager_pid, experiment_manager_pid(),
	  "PID of the experiment manager" },

	{ world_manager_pid, world_manager_pid(), "PID of the world manager" },

	{ dataflows, [ dataflow_pid() ],
	  "a list of the dataflow instances known of this experiment manager" } ] ).


% Helpers:
-export([ to_string/1 ]).



% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Core.Dataflow.Experiment.EntryPoint" ).


% For types and shorthands:
-include("dataflow_defines.hrl").


% For WOOPER, actor types, etc.:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").


% Shorthands:
-type ustring() :: text_utils:ustring().



% @doc Constructs the experiment entry point.
%
% Construction parameters are:
%
% - ActorSettings describes the actor abstract identifier (AAI) and seed of this
% actor, as assigned by the load balancer
%
% - Dataflows is a list of the dataflows that this entry point should drive
%
% - ExperimentManagerPid is the PID of the experiment manager
%
% - WorldManagerPid is the PID of the world manager

	% registered dataflows.
	%
	% Then corresponding blocks may be activated, and the dataflow evaluated.
