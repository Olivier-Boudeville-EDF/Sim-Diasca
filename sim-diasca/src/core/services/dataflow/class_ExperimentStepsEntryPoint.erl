% @doc Class in charge, as a dataflow entry point, to <b>manage simulation
% steps</b>.
%
-module(class_ExperimentStepsEntryPoint).

-define( class_description,
		 "The experiment entry point is a singleton instance in charge of "
		 "being the (logical) starting point that impulses the evaluation of "
		 "the registered dataflows, possibly at each timestep; technically it "
		 "is run in second position, just after the experiment exit point that "
		 "triggers it. "
		 "This specialised version of the ExperimentEntryPoint has been "
		 "introduced in order to manage simulation steps."
		 "Note: no class_ExperimentStepsExitPoint has been defined, as the "
		 "base implementation (class_ExperimentExitPoint) is sufficient "
		 "here." ).


% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_ExperimentEntryPoint ] ).



% Design notes:
%
% The Dataflow Entry Point knows the various dataflows involved, which is useful
% whenever having to create, update, delete, etc. dataflow blocks (which each
% pertains to a given dataflow).
%
% This (experiment) entry point knows the experiment manager (as it may have to
% perform experiment-level operations) but also the world manager (as it may
% typically impulse changes in the simulation world).


% Please refer to the 'Dataflow Entry & Exit Points' and 'Scheduling Cycle of
% Experiments' sections of the Dataflow HOWTO in order to understand why this
% actor is purely passive and (only) triggered by its ExperimentExitPoint
% counterpart component.



% Attributes that are specific to such an experiment entry point are:
-define( class_attributes, [

	{ current_step, step_count(),
	  "the current step at which the experiment is" },

	{ max_step, step_count(),
	  "the maximum step that the experiment may reach" } ] ).



% Helpers:
-export([ to_string/1 ]).


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Core.Dataflow.Experiment.EntryPoint" ).


% For types and shorthands:
-include("dataflow_defines.hrl").


% For WOOPER, actor types, etc.:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").


% Shorthands:
-type ustring() :: text_utils:ustring().
-type step_count() :: class_ExperimentManager:step_count().




% @doc Constructs this experiment entry point.
%
% Parameters are:
%
% - ActorSettings describes the actor abstract identifier (AAI) and seed of this
% actor, as assigned by the load balancer
%
% - Dataflows is a list of the dataflows that this entry point should drive
%
% - ExperimentStepStart is the step at which the experiment shall start
%
% - ExperimentStepStop is the step at which the experiment shall stop
%
% - ExperimentManagerPid is the PID of the experiment manager
%
% - WorldManagerPid is the PID of the world manager
%
