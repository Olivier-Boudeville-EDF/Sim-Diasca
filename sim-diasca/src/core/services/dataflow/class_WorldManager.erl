-define( class_description,
		 "The World Manager (WM) is a singleton instance in charge of "
		 "federating all the object managers that account, in a dataflow "
		 "context, for the simulated world." ).


% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).



% Design notes:
%
% The world manager is in charge of all the object managers. It is not itself an
% object manager (as it has sufficiently different features to cover), yet it
% is, directly or not, the parent of all of them.


% This singleton additionally interacts with its computational counterpart, the
% experiment manager (see class_ExperimentManager), which is expected to declare
% itself to this world manager.
%
% We also prefer buffering in the world manager all world events, until they are
% all completed, and then only send the whole to the experiment manager, rather
% than streaming them on the fly to it: the unit managers are then easier to
% develop, as they operate on a stable, final state of the world, rather than
% having for example to specify the completion of all the events they expect to
% rely on.
%
% As a consequence, this world manager must be told (typically by the experiment
% entry point) that all its input changesets have been transmitted, so that it
% can send all of them as a whole.
%
% The world manager applies each received changeset directly, and dispatches
% each of the corresponding events to the object manager in charge of it, based
% on the object type specified in the event (for binary association events, the
% dispatching is performed based on the *source* object type).

% Object managers do not send back to the world manager the whole events that
% completed, to avoid sending superfluous information. As a result they send
% back only a pair, made of the identifier of the completed event and of any
% completion-related extra information. This corresponds typically to, for
% example, the PID of a corresponding newly created dataflow object (so that the
% corresponding creation event gets complete).

% In the input changesets, some types of world events (connections and
% disconnections, at least) may refer to blocks in general, i.e. possibly
% processing units (in addition to the dataflow objects).
%
% These events will be included as they are in the changeset sent to the
% experiment manager (thus without being transformed by a particular object
% manager).



-type object_type_table() ::
		table( dataflow_object_type(), [ object_manager_pid() ] ).
% To determine the object manager in charge of a given object type, to dispatch
% events.


-type dispatch_table() :: table( object_manager_pid(), [ world_event() ] ).
% Table allowing to keep track of the world events that have been dispatched to
% a given object manager (and hence are waited for their report completion).
%
% Note: keeping track of the events *per object manager* is not necessary (a
% direct, plain list of events could have sufficed).


-type suspend_set() :: [ object_pid() ].
% A set of dataflow objects that shall be suspended:


-type suspend_table() :: list_table:list_table( dataflow_pid(), suspend_set() ).
% Allows to maintain, for each of the listed dataflow, which of their (dataflow)
% objects are to be suspended.
