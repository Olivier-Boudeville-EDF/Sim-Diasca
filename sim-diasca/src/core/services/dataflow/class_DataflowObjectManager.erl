-module(class_DataflowObjectManager).


-define( class_description,
		 "The dataflow object manager is a base (possibly overridden) class, "
		 "common to all actual managers for a given set of types of dataflow "
		 "objects (they are instances either directly of that class, or from "
		 "child classes thereof). "
		 "For example, if a simulation involves buildings in the form of "
		 "dataflow objects, these instances could be managed by a "
		 "BuildingManager that may inherit (probably directly) from the "
		 "current class, if some domain-specific handling of dataflow objects "
		 "is needed (ex: to manage specific associations); "
		 "otherwise this BuildingManager may simply be directly an instance of "
		 "the current class. "
		 "If relevant, a given object manager may take care of multiple types "
		 "of objects (ex: a manager may be in charge of the building "
		 "instances, but also the ones of dwellings, households, lifts, etc.). "
		 "Each object manager is directly linked to the world manager. "
		 "Each object manager is a singleton and registers itself globally "
		 "under its name - which is, conventionally, its actual classname "
		 "(ex: 'class_BuildingManager' or, if needing more clarity, "
		 "'class_BuildingObjectManager'). It registers as well to the world "
		 "manager. "
		 "As an object manager may have to create dataflow objects at runtime "
		 "(for the types of objects it is in charge of), it must itself be a "
		 "(simulation) actor." ).


% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).



% Design notes:

% Managing object types.
%
% An object manager may be dedicated to a given object type, or may handle
% multiple object types (typically if they are tightly linked, and thus to be
% managed in a single operation).
%
% We want ultimately that the world manager (i.e. the root, top-level object
% manager) stores the full table allowing to convert an object type (ex:
% 'Building' or 'Dwelling') into the PID of the object manager in charge of that
% type.
%
% Object managers are to declare themselves to the world manager.

% Dataflow objects may be created statically (whereas the simulation is not
% started, i.e. as initial objects, typically from the simulation case) or
% dynamically (while the simulation is running, i.e. as runtime objects,
% typically from the experiment entry point or, as expected, from dataflow
% object managers).



% Managing events and induced ones.

% When applying a changeset, all first level events are applied in turn (in the
% same diasca). Then they are stored (in the triggered_events attribute, with a
% tick-based timestamp) so that, on completion, their induced events can be
% applied in turn (this is true for creations and destructions, that may last
% for an unbounded number of diascas, and also for "shorter", constant-time,
% oneway operations like associations or updates, to preserve uniformity and
% induction order).
%
% A given object manager is expected to be able to handle by itself all induced
% events stemming from the events it handles.
%
% A changeset possibly modifies the structure of the dataflow and the state of
% at least some of its blocks.
%
% Blocks that have at least one of their input ports assigned shall be put in
% the suspended state, to prevent that get activated while the dataflow is still
% being modified.
%
% When all changesets have been applied, these blocks shall be explicitly
% resumed so that the actual evaluation of the dataflow(s) can take place. As a
% result, the set of blocks (most probably dataflow objects) that will have to
% be resumed must be kept (in addition to calling their *Suspending* methods
% such as setSuspendingInputPortValue/4); this suspended list is managed
% by the dataflow itself (see the declareSuspendedBlock* methods).



% The attributes that are specific to an object manager are:
-define( class_attributes, [

	{ object_table, object_table(), "an associative table whose keys are the "
	  "types of objects that are managed by this instance and whose values are "
	  "(supposedly exhaustive) lists of instances of that type (these "
	  "instances are only referenced, not owned, as their life cycle is to be "
	  "managed by their parent dataflow)" },

	{ world_manager_pid, world_manager_pid(), "PID of the world manager" },

	{ dispatch_table, table( object_manager_pid(), [ world_event() ] ),
	  "a table associating to an object manager a list of the world events "
	  "whose application was dispatched to it" },

	{ triggered_events, [ world_event() ], "a list of the (time-stamped, to "
	  "detect unhandled events) world events whose application is triggered "
	  "yet not completed; once done, their completion will be reported to the "
	  "world manager" },

	{ completed_event_infos, [ completed_event_info() ], "a list of the "
	  "information about the world events that have been completed, yet not "
	  "reported yet to the world manager" },

	{ injected_events, [ world_event() ], "a list of the world events that "
	  "the processing of another event led to inject (ex: if a child class of "
	  "this class processed the creation of a car, it may inject 4 creation "
	  "events for each of the associated wheels)" },

	{ load_balancer_pid, load_balancer_pid(), "PID of the load balancer, "
	  "useful to create new objects for example" },

	{ identification_server_pid, maybe( identification_server_pid() ),
	  "if enabled by the case, the PID of the identification server" } ] ).



% Helpers exported for convenience:
-export([ apply_world_events/3, to_string/1, get_object_pids/2,
		  create_runtime_object/4 ]).


-type object_table() :: table( dataflow_object_type(), [ object_pid() ] ).
% Records all instances of a managed object type.



-type completed_event_info() ::
		{ event_id(), class_WorldManager:completion_extra_info() }.
% Records the identifier of a completed event and any additional relevant
% information (such as the PID of the created object should it refers to a
% creation event)
%
% (exported to avoid unused warning)


-export_type([ object_table/0, completed_event_info/0 ]).



% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Core.Dataflow.World.ObjectManager" ).


% For input_port_spec and all:
-include("dataflow_defines.hrl").


% For WOOPER, actor types, etc.:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").


-type object_manager_def() ::
		{ object_manager_name(), [ dataflow_object_type() ] }.
% Definition of any object manager that is defined by default (i.e. with no
% specific construction parameter), based only on its name and on a list of the
% types of dataflow objects it is to manage.



% Shorthands:

-type ustring() :: text_utils:ustring().

-type classname() :: wooper:classname().

%
% An object manager is not linked to any particular dataflow (as there may exist
% multiple dataflow instances).
