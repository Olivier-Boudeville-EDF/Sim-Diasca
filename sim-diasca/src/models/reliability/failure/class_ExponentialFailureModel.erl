% MTTF is Mean Time To Failure, the mean (average) time before a working system
% fails.
%
% It is measured thanks to a tuple {days,hours,minutes,seconds}.
%
% All equipments using a given instance of this failure model will therefore
% have the same MTTF, but the shared random manager (thanks to the stochastic
% inheritance) will ensure each will act independently from the other
% equipments, according to the exponential distribution.
