% @doc Class modelling the reparation behaviour of pieces of equipment according
% to a uniform law.

-module(class_UniformRepairModel).


-define( class_description,
		 "Class modelling the reparation behaviour of equipments according "
		 "to a uniform law (probability density)."
		 "It is a less common repair model than the Gaussian one."
		 "See: class_GaussianRepairModel." ).


% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_RepairModel ] ).


% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization,
		 "Actor.StochasticActor.RepairModel.UniformRepairModel" ).



% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").



% @doc Constructs a uniform repair model actor.
%
% - ActorSettings corresponds to the engine settings for this actor, as
% determined by the load-balancer
%
% - MTTR is Mean Time To Repair, the mean (average) time that a device will take
% to recover from a non-terminal failure
%
% The MaxTTR could be taken here as a workload: with one resource set to repair
% the equipment, it evaluates the time to repair.
%
% Affecting more resources leads to decreased repair durations. So it is a
% measure of the failure gravity in itself, not depending on the repair
% resources.

	% First the direct mother classes:

	% Computing maximum TTR (expressed in seconds):
	MaxTTR = MaxTTRsecond + 60*( MaxTTRminute + 60*(MaxTTRhour+24*MaxTTRday) ),

	% Defines an uniform repair profile, for stochastic class to manage it:
	RepairState = class_RepairModel:construct( State, ActorSettings,
		?trace_categorize("Uniform repair model"), { uniform, MaxTTR } ),

	?send_info_fmt( RepairState,
