	% This field describes the eligible computing hosts that may take part to

	%
	% - a list whose elements are either {Hostname,Username} pairs (both being
	% specified as atoms) or just Hostname, designating a set of computers and
	% associated logins that can take part to the simulation, like in: [
	% computer_a.foo.org, {computer_b.bar.org,boudevil} ]; if no username is
	% specified for a host, then the one of the user node will be selected for
	% that host; finally, specifying only such a list implies the use of the
	% local host, which will be automatically added to the list
	%
	% - or a pair made of the previous list and of an atom telling whether the
	% current node should be added to the node list: either 'include_localhost'
	% (may not be specified since, as already mentioned, this is true by
	% default) or 'exclude_localhost', if we do no want the user computer
	% from which the simulation is launched to take part to the computings
	% (ex: {[computer_a.foo.org], exclude_localhost})
	%
	% - or localhost_only, implying that the execution is not wanted to be
	% distributed, just being wanted to run on the local host (with the current
	% user)
	%
	% - or a pair made of an atom, which is use_host_file or
	% use_host_file_otherwise_local, and the filename of an existing text files
	% which lists candidates in terms of computing hosts, each filename being
	% either:
	%
	%    - alone on its line, specified as an atom (ex: 'myhost.example.org')
	%
	%    - or in a pair with a string-based comment (which is ignored by
	%    Sim-Diasca, its only purpose is to help to maintain the list), like in:
	%    {myhost.example.org,"Computer used by Olivier Boudeville in B-226"}
	%
	%    - or in a hostname-username-comment triplet, username being specified
	%    as an atom, like in: {myotherhost.example.org, 'E44927SW', "My new
	%    Laptop"} (supposing that E44927SW is a valid username here)
	%
	% Each entry must be alone in its line, which must end with a dot (see
	% sim-diasca-host-candidates-sample.txt for a full example).
	%
	% The use_host_file atom requires such a file to be available and usable,
	% whereas the use_host_file_otherwise_local will not fail if such a file is
	% not available, it will just then fall-back to a localhost_only policy
	%
	% If using 'use_host_file', a third element can be added to the tuple,
	% 'include_localhost' or 'exclude_localhost', knowing that if none is
	% specified (the tuple is just a pair), the local host will be included.
	%
	% So examples for this field could be:
	% - [computer_a, computer_b] (which implies include_localhost)
	% - [computer_a, {computer_b,joe}] (which implies include_localhost)
	% - {[computer_a, computer_b], include_localhost}
	% - {[computer_a, computer_b], exclude_localhost}
	% - localhost_only

	% - {use_host_file_otherwise_local, "sim-diasca-host-candidates.txt"}
	% - {use_host_file_otherwise_local, "sim-diasca-host-candidates.txt"}
	%
	% Of course if the local host is implied, it will be associated with the

	% Allows to specify a list of third-party elements (code and/or data) that

	%
	% These elements may include the upper layer of the actual simulator itself
	% (typically the models and any helper modules that are to be run on top of
	% the simulation engine), simulation-specific data files, or anything else.
	%
	% These elements will be added to the deployment archive, and thus a copy of
	% them will be sent and be available locally on each of the computing nodes,
	% during the simulation.
	%
	% The general form of an element in this list is
	% {ElementPath, ElementType, ElementOptions}, where:
	%
	% - ElementPath is a path, specified as a plain string, to this element to
	% deploy; it is either an absolute path (ex:
	% "/home/stallone/My-data/foo.dat"), or a path relative to the current
	% directory - i.e. the directory in which the simulation case is run (ex:
	% "../my-data/bootstrap-infos"; this will expect the 'my-data' directory to
	% be in the parent directory from the one of the case being run); if a
	% specified path refers to a file, that file will be added to the deployment
	% archive. If a specified path refers to a directory, then it will be
	% recursively scanned at archive creation, in order to look-up the content
	% to integrate to the archive, depending on the element type below
	%
	% - ElementType tells what is the content type of the specified element
	% path; it can be either:
	%
	%  - 'data', which implies that this content is opaque and will be used 'as
	%  is', without further management (a file will thus be included verbatim, a
	%  directory will be recursively scanned and all its content will be added
	%  to the deployment archive; tree structure will be preserved, thus the
	%  computing nodes will see the exact same tree, with the exact same content
	%  as found in the user node from which the deployment archive was created)
	%
	%  - 'code', which implies that the deployment manager is to look-up BEAM
	%  files only (always from the directory whence the simulation is run),
	%  either specified explicitly (in this case one specific file is targeted,
	%  ex: ElementPath="my-simulator/ebin/my_sim_case.beam"), or as a whole from
	%  a parent directory (then the corresponding tree will be scanned, and all
	%  found BEAM files - and only them - will be added to the archive, ex:
	%  ElementPath="my-simulator/ebin/second-generation-models"); note that a
	%  default, implicit { code, "../src" } entry is automatically added (should
	%  this directory exist) in this field, to spare the need to declare, in a
	%  given test case, to forcibly the directory where the tested code lies
	%
	% - ElementOptions is a (possibly empty) list of options that correspond to
	%  the element type and that will apply to the specified element path:
	%
	%  - options valid for all element types are:
	%
	%     - {exclude_directories, PathList} where PathList is a list of
	%     directories relative to ElementPath (supposed to be itself a
	%     directory): these directories will not be searched for content; for
	%     example: {exclude_directories, ["ebin/v1", "test", "doc"]}
	%
	%     - {exclude_suffixes, ExcludeSuffixList} where ExcludeSuffixList is a
	%     list of suffixes that will be blacklisted (filenames ending with them
	%     will be rejected); for example {exclude_suffixes, [ "_test.beam",
	%     "-local.dat", ".png" ]}
	%
	%     - {keep_only_suffixes, KeptSuffixList} where KeptSuffixList is a list
	%     of suffixes that will be white-listed (filenames ending with them will
	%     be accepted, and only them); this option will be processed last,
	%     i.e. *after* exclusions (usage example: for a given path, first a set
	%     of directories is excluded, then some suffixes are specifically
	%     excluded (ex: "_test.beam"), then only the ".beam" and ".dat" suffixes
	%     are kept, allowing to end up with exactly the targeted content
	%
	%     - 'rebuild' (the default for elements of type code): uses GNU 'make'
	%     to trigger any needed rebuild (note that code but also data may have
	%     to be rebuilt); if ElementPath designates a file, an attempt to
	%     rebuild that specific file will be performed prior to its integration
	%     into the deployment archive; if ElementPath designates a directory, a
	%     rebuild from that root will be attempted, before scanning it
	%     recursively for content to integrate into the deployment archive
	%
	%     - 'no_rebuild' (the default for elements of type data): no rebuild
	%     attempt will be performed, the content look-up will be directly
	%     triggered
	%
	%  - for element type 'data', no additional specific option can be specified
	%
	%  - for element type 'code', no additional specific option can be specified
	%
	% Finally, if only one element option is to be specified, the enclosing list
	% can be itself omitted.
	%
	% Should no specific element options have to be specified, this member can
	% be omitted as a whole.
	%
	% If a list-based option (i.e. exclude_directories, exclude_suffixes or
	% keep_only_suffixes) is specified more than once for a given element path,
	% then all these values will be automatically merged.
	%
	% The selection rules are always applied in the same order: first, the
	% exclusions (of directories and/or suffixes), then the inclusions (of kept
	% suffixes).
	%
	% As an example, a valid specification of additional elements to deploy
	% could be: [ {"settings/models.dat", data}, {"/home/foo/coord.bin", data,
	% []}, {"class_MyModel.beam", code}, {"model-repository/v1.3", code,

	% maximum number of simultaneous losses of computing hosts that the
	% simulation will be able to overcome without crashing (which implies some
	% overhead) - provided the remaining hosts are able to sustain the demanded
	% load.
	%
	% For example, k=0 is equivalent to 'none'; if k=3, then as long as "only"
	% 1, 2 ou 3 computing hosts fail at the same time during the simulation, it
	% will be nevertheless able to resist and continue. There is no upper bound
	% to the total losses in the simulation, provided that at any time the k
	% threshold is not exceeded and that the remaining hosts can sustain the
	% resulting load.
	%
	% Note that this resilience applies to random computing hosts; for example,
	% if the host that is lost is the one of the root time manager, the
	% simulation will crash regardless of the value of k. Depending on the
	% simulation services that are enabled by a case, more single points of
	% failure may be introduced as the engine chooses to dispatch them evenly,
	% hence on a larger number of hosts.
	%
	% Similarly, should a long-enough network split happen, the k threshold can
	% be immediately reached.
	%
	% Currently no support is offered for hosts that would join in the course of
	% the simulation, for example spare hosts dynamically added to compensate
	% for previous losses.
	%
	% This service is implemented by stopping the simulation at regular
	% milestones (in wall-clock time), serializing the state of the actors on
	% each computing hosts, and sending them to k well-chosen other hosts. Then,
	% as long as up to k hosts fail, the simulation can still rely on a snapshot
	% for the last met milestone, and restart from it (provided the remaining
	% hosts are powerful enough to support the whole simulation alone).
	%
	% Note: this feature was partial and utterly experimental, and has not been
	% updated since its creation, whereas new services have been introduced
	% since then. As long as this uncommon feature has not been revisited, one
	% should not activate it.
