% Directly obtained from traces_test_footer.hrl.


% Defines all the macros and exports useful for trace-using cases.
%
% Allows to define exports before functions: macros and functions have been
% split so that overall header files can be defined which start with all macros
% and finish with all function definitions.




% Define functions as late as possible in headers:

-ifndef(tracing_activated).


% Allows to avoid warnings about variables not be used when traces are disabled.


-spec case_trace_disabled( any() ) -> 'case_trace_disabled'.
case_trace_disabled( _ ) ->
	case_trace_disabled.



-spec case_trace_disabled( any(), any() ) -> 'case_trace_disabled'.
case_trace_disabled( _, _ ) ->
	case_trace_disabled.


-endif. % tracing_activated
