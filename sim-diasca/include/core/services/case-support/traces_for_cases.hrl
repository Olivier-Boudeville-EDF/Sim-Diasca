% Defines some macros and functions useful for trace-using cases.
% This is thus the main/only header file such cases should include.

% Note: directly obtained from traces_for_tests.hrl.

% We have kept macros for all the traces (including the ones for cases, and
% start/stop) for the sake of consistency. Moreover doing so allows to
% communicate more easily with agents like the trace aggregator (as we can then
% share discretly variables like TraceAggregatorPid).


% Defines everything regarding application traces:
-include("traces_case_header.hrl").


% For the export of run/0:
-include("case_facilities.hrl").


% To avoid warnings if not used:
-export([ case_failed/1, case_failed/2, test_failed/1, test_failed/2 ]).


% To perform receives from cases:
-include("receive_helpers_header.hrl").


% For notify_* and al:
-include_lib("traces/include/traces.hrl").





% Start/stop section.




% From here the trace supervisor is not started, due to a renaming to happen
% later, in sim_diasca:init/3.
%
% As a consequence, if a given test/case is not to call sim_diasca:init/3, it
% should not use the case_* macros (prefer the test_* ones in
% traces_for_tests.hrl), otherwise no trace supervisor will be created.


-ifdef(tracing_activated).


% TraceAggregatorPid voluntarily exported from case_start, for case_stop:

-define( case_start,
	% No supervisor wanted from scratch, as their trace file will have to be
	% renamed and the LogMX supervisor cannot change the file it is tracking:
	%
	% (not binding even a mute variable, would have been:
	% _InitTraceSupervisor=false)
	%
	TraceAggregatorPid = traces_for_cases:case_start( ?MODULE, false )
).
