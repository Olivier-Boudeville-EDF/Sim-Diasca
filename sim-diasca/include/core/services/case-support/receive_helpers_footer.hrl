% Introduced so that for example static methods performing receives can still
% filter the incoming messages.



% Helper macro for those who would not know they could have called the
% corresponding function directly:
%
-define( case_receive, case_receive() ).



% Helper macro for those who would not know they could have called the

-define( case_receive( AnyMessage ), case_receive( AnyMessage ) ).


% For test support:
-define( test_receive, case_receive() ).
-define( test_receive( AnyMessage ), case_receive( AnyMessage ) ).


% @doc Helper function to write receive clauses in cases which cannot interfere
% with trace supervision, as a case may also receive trace control message the
% case code should be unware of.
%
% Returns the received value.
%
% Ex: Pid ! {getBaz, [], self()}, MyBaz = case_receive(), ...
%
% to be used instead of:
%
% Pid ! {getBaz, [], self()},
% receive
%
%   {wooper_result, V} ->
%        V
%
% end,
% ...
%
% Note that, should the result message be appropriately taggued (hence removing
% any possibility of not selecting the right answer), a standard receive clause
% may be used, however case_receive/1 may still be more appropriate.
