% Centralisation of defines, type definitions, etc. to manage changesets between
% a dataflow and an external counterpart (ex: maintained by a more global
% platform) with whom a (possibly bidirectional) synchronisation shall be
% performed.

% Note: not expected to be directly included, user code should rely on
% sim_diasca*.hrl instead.



% The synchronisation discussed here attempts to ensure that the current
% dataflow (namely its objects and units) matches an external reference
% describing the state of the simulation world and the operations to be applied
% on it.


-type external_id() :: any().

% type - after their initial element, their record tag).

% schedules that event (ex: induced events are scheduled later than at their
% arrival).
