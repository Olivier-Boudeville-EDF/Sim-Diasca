% Duration, in virtual time, of a fundamental tick of the simulation.
% It must be a strictly positive floating-point value.
%
% This duration is expressed in seconds; as it is a floating-point value, a tick
% may last (in simulation time, as opposed to wallclock time) for less than one
% virtual second.
%
% For example, if duration is 20ms (i.e. 0.02 virtual second), then the
% simulation frequency will be 50Hz.
%
% If the duration of a basic time step is 5 minutes (i.e. 300 virtual seconds),
% then the simulation frequency will be 1/300Hz.
%
% As a consequence, frequencies may be arbitrarily low or high. One should
% nevertheless ensure that rounding errors (ex: when dealing with very low
% frequencies) do not interfere. The conversion functions between virtual
% durations and tick counts acts as a safety net (they ensure that the relative
% error remains smaller than a threshold, either a default one or a user-defined
% one).

% We can be in interactive mode without having to make the real and virtual
% units correspond one-to-one: virtual time can be scaled up or down compared to
% the time base (usually, real time).
%
% For example, 1 second in user (wall-clock) time may represent 1 simulated day
% (thus for a value of 3600*24), while still having a simulation running in
% interactive mode.

	% The outputs that this simulation regards as results that are actually
	% needed are the ones that correspond to the result specification for that

	% - either 'all_outputs', to retrieve results from all producers, with their
	% default settings (for larger simulations the volume of the results is
	% quickly overwhelming and a waste of resource)
	%
	% - or 'no_output' to retrieve no result from any producer (should be used
	% for debugging only, as a simulation exhibiting no result is of little
	% interest)
	%
	% - or 'all_basic_probes_only', to retrieve results from all plain probes
	% (with default basic probe settings), and only from them
	%
	% - or 'all_virtual_probes_only', to retrieve results from all virtual
	% probes (with default virtual proble settings) hosted by data-logger(s),
	% and only from these probes
	%
	% - or, in the general case, a list of options, among:
	%
	%  - {targeted_patterns, TargetPatterns} where TargetPatterns is a list of
	%  elements, each being:
	%
	%   - either a standalone regular expression pattern, expressed as a plain
	%    string, that allows to select which outputs are to be promoted to
	%    results; no option is specified here, thus default ones will be used
	%
	%    - or a pair, whose first element is such a regular expression pattern,
	%    and second one is either a standalone option (specified as an atom,
	%    among 'data_only', 'rendering_only', and 'data_and_rendering',
	%    depending on what is requested by the user) or a list of such
	%    corresponding producer options
	%
	%  - {blacklisted_patterns, BlacklistPatterns} where BlacklistPatterns is
	%  a list of regular expression patterns, expressed as plain strings,
	%  allowing to remove elements among the ones that the previous targeted
	%  patterns selected
	%
	% As a consequence, each output in turn will be matched against each
	% targeted pattern; as soon as the name of this output matches one of these
	% patterns, it will be selected, with the corresponding options (if any);
	% then it will be matched in turn against each of the blacklisted patterns;
	% as soon as the output name matches one of these patterns, it will be
	% removed.
	%
	% At the end, the selected results are the targeted non-blacklisted outputs,
	% and only them.
	%
	% Ex: result_specification = [
	%
	%   {targeted_patterns, [{"*-case-A-*",rendering_only}, "*-case-B-*",
	%                           {"my-test-probe", [data_and_rendering]}]},
	%
	%   {blacklisted_patterns, ["*-emitter-(first|second)-*"]}]
	%
	% Note that if strings are not separated by commas (ex: ["aaa" "bbb"],
	% instead of ["aaa", "bbb"]), then they will be concatenated by the
	% preprocessor and be equivalent to "aaabbb" (which, in the general case,
	% leads to different selections than ["aaa", "bbb"]).
	%
	% Note also that the patterns are checked against the name of the output
	% (ex: "my interesting probe"), not against its translation to be a proper
	% filename (ex: "my_interesting_probe"). As a result, the corresponding
	% pattern should target the former, not the latter, as it would not match
	% otherwise.
	%
	% Patterns are to be expressed according to the “Perl Compatible Regular
	% Expressions” conventions, or PCRE for short.
