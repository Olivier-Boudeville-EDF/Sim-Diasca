% This header centralizes some simulation-wide settings.



% Separating mute/by speak allows to use different notifications (ex: shorter if
% spoken, for example ticks are far too long to be spoken).

% As notify_mute needs an implicit 'State' variable, it cannot be a function, it
% is therefore a macro, and notify_by_speak too for homogeneity.
