% This is the main Sim-Diasca header file.
%
% It is defined to define a base for user code only, so that it has only to
% include a single header (sim_diasca_for_{models,cases}.hrl).
%
% Note: this main helper header file shall only list includes (i.e. it shall not
% define anything by itself) so that the Sim-Diasca code (as opposed to user
% code) never includes by convention that header (it always can include any of
% its needed subheaders instead).


% For all dataflow-related defines (includes common ones):
%-include("dataflow_defines.hrl").

% For all bindings-related defines:
%-include("bindings.hrl").

% For load_balancer_pid() and all:
%-include("class_LoadBalancer.hrl").

% For deployment_settings and all:
%-include("class_DeploymentManager.hrl").

% For all actor-related types:
%-include("class_TimeManager.hrl").

-include("engine_common_defines.hrl").

% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include_lib("traces/include/class_TraceEmitter.hrl").
