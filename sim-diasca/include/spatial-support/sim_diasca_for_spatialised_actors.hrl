% This is the main Sim-Diasca header file for simulation models (a.k.a. actors).
%
% It is defined so that actual actors can include a single header, this one, on
% a future-proof manner.


% Like sim_diasca_base.hrl, except for trace emitter:

% For all dataflow-related defines (includes common ones):
%-include("dataflow_defines.hrl").

% For all bindings-related defines:
%-include("bindings.hrl").

% For load_balancer_pid() and all:
%-include("class_LoadBalancer.hrl").

% For deployment_settings and all:
%-include("class_DeploymentManager.hrl").

% For all actor-related types:
%-include("class_TimeManager.hrl").


-include("engine_common_defines.hrl").


% Defined to be shared:
-include("sim_diasca_actor_types.hrl").


% Allows to define WOOPER base variables and methods for that class:
-include_lib("wooper/include/wooper.hrl").

% For spatial-aware traces:
-include("class_SpatialTraceEmitter.hrl").
