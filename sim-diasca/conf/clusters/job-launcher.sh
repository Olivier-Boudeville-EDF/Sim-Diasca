USAGE="

Usage: "$(basename $0)" [ --quiet ] [ --debug ] EXECUTABLE [PARAMETERS]
Launches the specified executable with specified parameters on the cluster, through either a PBS-based job manager or a SLURM one."

# Note: this script interacts with the job manager, and is not Sim-Diasca
# specific per se.


# This script typically outputs on the console something like (with a
# PBS-compliant job manager):

# Job identifier is 1806204, its state is:
#	Job_Name  = Sim-Diasca
#	Job_Owner = boudevil@cla11pfr
#	job_state = Q
#	queue = parall_8
# Job queued on Thursday, October 21, 2010, at 10:51:41, waiting until it is
# scheduled and run...

# And produces for example following files in
# /scratch/$USER/Software/Sim-Diasca/Sim-Diasca-current-install:
#  - Sim-Diasca.e1806204
#  - Sim-Diasca.e1806204

# A temporary file (ex: /tmp/.sim-diasca-qsub-10733.txt) is also created, it
# just contains the corresponding job ID and server node.


# With SLURM we have a typical output like:

# Using specified and validated install root directory
# /scratch/E21850/Software/Sim-Diasca/Sim-Diasca-current-install.
#Started on Wednesday, February 4, 2015, at 17:03:07.
#  Rebuilding selectively Sim-Diasca in production mode...
#(not performing any initial clean-up)
#  Unmuting modules of interest
#  Generating the cluster script...
#  Submitting it to the job manager (slurm)...
#Job 2405075 submitted on Wednesday, February 4, 2015, at 17:03:16, waiting until it is scheduled and run...
