Sim-Diasca Support
------------------

It is not required to apply any meaningless procedure or know any code word to get some support:

:raw-html:`<center><img src="xkcd-tech_support.png"></img></center>`
:raw-latex:`\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{xkcd-tech_support.png}`


No need either for a specific support registration form:

:raw-html:`<center><img src="xkcd-a_new_captcha_approach.png"></img></center>`
:raw-latex:`\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{xkcd-a_new_captcha_approach.png}`


Just be sure to have read beforehand the `Sim-Diasca Troubleshooting`_ section.

Of course, if ever changes were made to the Sim-Diasca codebase, testing also against a vanilla (pristine) release may help discriminating among the many possible causes:

If the issue remains, then probably that some support could help.


However, surely that, rather than reporting "this does not work!", we would prefer a more detailed bug report, mentioning at least:

- your version of Sim-Diasca and of other tools (including Erlang)
- your platform (hardware and software)
- the detailed error message (preferably including stack trace, context and prior outputs, even if it is long)
- the trace output, i.e. the full trace file (e.g. ``my_case_test.traces``), which is a very valuable source of troubleshooting information



The simplest approach is to double-check your problem and then contact directly the Si-Diasca maintainer, Olivier Boudeville, preferably by email (using the address at the top of this document for that).

Support will be done on a best-effort basis (no commercial support available).
