Congratulations, you reached the end of this developer guide!

Now you should write your own test models, getting inspiration from the *Sim-Diasca Mock Simulators* (see the top-level ``mock-simulators`` directory in the source archive).

Writing such toy models is surely the shortest path to the understanding of Sim-Diasca conventions, no matter how fruitless an activity it may seem:

We hope that you will enjoy using Sim-Diasca. As always, any (constructive!) feedback is welcome (use `this email address <mailto:olivier.boudeville@edf.fr>`_ for that). Thanks!
