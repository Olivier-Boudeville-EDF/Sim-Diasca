% @doc This test case is only meant to test that we can run, besides tests,
% cases as well.
%
% The content of this file is exactly the one of
% scheduling_one_periodic_actor_test.erl.
%
% The test could run until tick offset #120, however the next tick after offset
% #80 at which this only actor will be scheduled will trigger its
% termination. Therefore the simulation should end automatically at this tick.
%
% Test can be run on for example two computers, to ensure an empty node (as
% there is only one actor) is correctly managed.
