% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").


% Implementation notes:


% When a test actor A adds another test actor B as peer:
%
% - for A, B is a target peer
%
% - for B, A becomes (as soon as the first hello message is received) a source
% peer
%
% If target B terminates, it has to call 'removePeer' on source A, otherwise A
% would keep on sending hello messages to a non-existing B and would block.
%
% So B has to store the PID of A.
%
% However, if A terminated before B, then the 'removePeer' call from B on A
% would itself block.
%
% Therefore source A, when terminating, needs also to notify target B, thanks to
% a 'forgetPeer' call.


% Moreover we have to rely on a deferred termination phase. Indeed if an actor A
% determines at timestamp {T,D} that it has to terminate, it will notify the
% actors it is interacting with (B1, B2, etc.) during this {T,D} timestamp, but
% they will take this message into account only at {T,D+1}. Thus they may still
% be sending messages to the terminating actor (A) at {T,D} and even {T,D+1} (if
% the shuffling of incoming messages results into the notification sent by the
% terminating actor to be processed lately).
%
% These perfectly licit messages would then be processed by the terminating
% actor at {T,D+2}, possibly after it declared its termination, which is not
% wanted (for example, if it was already deleted, it could not acknowledge this
% message and this would block the simulation).
%
% So the actual termination should occur here no sooner than {T,D+3}. It could
% occur then, but, as there could be a chain of interacting actors (B1 having to
% notify C that A is leaving), we could imagine that licit messages could arrive
% at {T,D+4} and later diascas.
%
% To ease the troubleshooting of models, terminating actors will be *actually*
% deleted only at the next tick, so that they can be able to detect messages
% received whereas they have terminated (in the diascas in-between).
%
% So, when an actor decides at {T,D} it will terminate, it has to call its
% declareTermination/2 oneway (or the class_Actor:declare_termination/2 helper
% function), whose second parameter is the number of intercalary diascas which
% is wanted before being considered as terminated, which is a positive number
% (possibly zero) or the atom 'unlimited'.
%
% This call will immediately set the 'next_action' attribute of this actor to
% 'terminating' (so that, for example, it can still acknowledge, but choose to
% ignore otherwise, any incoming actor message that was sent before the
% termination information propagated).
%
% Receiving an actor message while in 'terminating' cannot be avoided in the
% general case (race condition between normal exchanges and the termination
% notification) and is not an error (generally these messages are just to be
% ignored). Then as many diasca as specified will be requested by this actor
% (which thus will be scheduled as many times). Then its 'next_action' attribute
% will be set to 'terminated' (the actor could be deleted then, but deferring
% this deletion favors the debugging), and any new actor message that would be
% received will be interpreted this time as an error.
%
% At the beginning of the next tick, the actor will be deleted for good.
%
% If, instead of specifying a number of intercalary diascas, 'unlimited' was
% specified, then the next_action of this actor will be set and left to
% 'terminating' (never reaching 'terminated'); the actor will not request any
% diasca, will accept any new actor message and will be deallocated as soon as
% the next tick begins.



% Two ways of adding a peer have to be defined. Indeed, to do so initially, we
% need to perform some synchronisation, thus we need a request (thus
% addInitialPeer/2), whereas adding a peer while the simulation is running
% implies using an actor for that, thus using an (actor) oneway (addPeer/2).

% Later: add the use of a virtual probe, to test also write and overall
% scalability.

-type tick_offset() :: class_TimeManager:tick_offset().



% @doc Constructs a test actor:
%
% - ActorSettings corresponds to the various information (ex: AAI, seeding,
% ordering mode, etc.) that the load-balancer sets for each newly created actor
%
% - ActorName the name of the actor
%
% - SchedulingSettings describes how this test actor is to drive its scheduling,
% among:
%
%  - {periodic, P} where P is the requested number of ticks between two
%  spontaneous behaviours
%
%  - {erratic, MinRange} where MinRange allows to set up to how many ticks
%  should elapse in general between two erratic scheduling
%
% - CreationSettings describes if and how this test actor is to create other
% actors, among:
%
%  - no_creation: never creates an actor
%
%  - {InterCount, KindOfCreatedActor} where Count specifies the number of
%  spontaneous schedulings before an actor is created, and KindOfCreatedActor,
%  describes its policies, thanks to a {SchedulingPolicy, CreationPolicy} pair
%
% - TerminationTickOffset the duration after which this actor should terminate
