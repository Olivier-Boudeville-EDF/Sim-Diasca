% Overall unit test of the Sim-Diasca deployment and scheduling framework.



% The test could run until tick offset #120, however the next tick after offset
% #80 at which this only actor will be scheduled will trigger its
% termination. Therefore the simulation should end automatically at this tick.
%
% The test actor actually intended to stop at offset #50, but it planned
% actually its spontaneous ticks at #48 then #51, thus delaying its termination.
%
% Test can be run on for example two computers, to ensure an empty node (as
% there is only one actor) is correctly managed.

% To check that the unique erratic actor is correctly scheduled, here is the
% overall behaviour it is expected to respect:


% For facilities common to all cases:
-include("sim_diasca_for_cases.hrl").
