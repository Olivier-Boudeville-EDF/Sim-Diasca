		simulation_name="Web result management test" },


	% For this test of course we have to enable a local webserver; we rely here

	% specified here), namely ~/Software/sim_diasca_webserver_install_root

		" based on computing hosts specified as ~p.",
		[ DeploymentSettings#deployment_settings.computing_hosts ] ),
