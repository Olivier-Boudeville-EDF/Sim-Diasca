-define( class_description,
		 "Test of the data-exchange facilities, from a simulation actor." ).


% Determines what are the direct mother classes of this class (if any):
-define( superclasses, [ class_Actor ] ).


-define( class_attributes, [

	{ data_key, class_DataExchanger:key(),
	  "designates a value of interest read and possibly modified by this "
	  "test actor interacting with the data-exchanger" },

	{ termination_tick_offset, class_TimeManager:tick_offset(),
	  "the tick offset at which this test actor will terminate" },

	{ talkative, boolean(), "tells whether this actor is talkative" },

	{ expected_value, integer(), "records the test expected value" } ] ).



% Must be included before class_TraceEmitter header:
-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "Actor.Test.DataExchange" ).


% Allows to use macros for trace sending:
-include("sim_diasca_for_actors.hrl").




% Implementation notes:
%
% This test actor will perform data-exchanges (read/modify/write). The point is
% that it does not even know whether the simulation is started or not (in this
% case it is an initial actor).



% @doc Constructs a test actor for data-exchange:
%
% - ActorSettings corresponds to the engine settings for this actor, as
% determined by the load-balancer
%
% - ActorName the name of the actor
%
% - DataKey is an atom corresponding to the key of a data entry of interest for
% that actor
%
% - TerminationTickOffset the duration after which this actor should terminate
