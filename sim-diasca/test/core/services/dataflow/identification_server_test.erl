% @doc The purpose of this module is to test the support provided by the

-module(identification_server_test).


% For facilities common to all cases:
-include("sim_diasca_for_cases.hrl").



% For myriad_spawn*:
-include_lib("myriad/include/spawn_utils.hrl").



% @doc Runs the test, determining the settings from the command-line, otherwise
