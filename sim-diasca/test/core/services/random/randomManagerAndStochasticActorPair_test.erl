	% Prefer reusing most default settings:
	SimulationSettings = #simulation_settings{

	% A deployment manager is created directly on the user node:
	DeploymentManagerPid = sim_diasca:init( SimulationSettings,
								DeploymentSettings, LoadBalancingSettings ),

	% ({RandomLawName, RandomSettings})

				   { my_second_uniform, {uniform,   100} },

				   { my_exponential,    {exponential,80} } ],


	% Creates an actor that will automatically subscribe itself to the manager
	% and that will terminate on specified tick:
	%
	class_Actor:create_initial_actor( class_TestStochasticActor,
		[ "Cartman", RandomLaws, _CartmanTerminationProbability=20 ] ),

	% Other actors:
	class_Actor:create_initial_actor( class_TestStochasticActor,
		[ "Kenny", RandomLaws, _KennyTerminationProbability=99 ] ),

	class_Actor:create_initial_actor( class_TestStochasticActor,
		[ "Kyle", RandomLaws, _KyleTerminationProbability=10 ] ),

	% A TestStochasticActor requesting - and consuming - no law was successfully
	% tested as well.


	% We want this test to end once a specified number of ticks are elapsed:
	StopTick = 30,

	DeploymentManagerPid ! { getRootTimeManager, [], self() },
	RootTimeManagerPid = test_receive(),

	?test_notice_fmt( "Starting simulation, "
					  "for a stop at tick offset ~B.", [ StopTick ] ),
