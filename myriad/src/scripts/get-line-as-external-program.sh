# This file is part of the Ceylan-Myriad library.


# Typically used internally to Myriad, by system_utils:get_line/1.

# This (most simple) script allows to collect user inputs, as lines entered
# thanks to the keyboard (e.g. for text_ui.erl) even if the Erlang VM is run
# with the -noinput setting, which apparently is necessary for other forms of
# user interactions such as /bin/dialog (see term_ui.erl).


# No prompt actually allowed, as no writing to the "standard" output can/should
# be done here (file descriptor 1, actually redirected to 4).

#prompt="$1"
#
#if [ -n "${prompt}" ]; then
#   echo "prompt: $1"
#fi
