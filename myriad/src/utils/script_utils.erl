% @doc Gathering helper functions for the <b>development and use of all kinds of
% scripts</b> (Erlang escripts and shell scripts alike).
%
% Intended use for escripts: add, in the script directory, a symbolic link to
% this module so that the script can readily call it and thus bootstrap the use
% of all others.
%
-module(script_utils).


% Implementation notes:
%
% The code path is not supposed to be updated with the one for 'Myriad', so
% extra care must be taken not to call Myriad helper modules for implementations
% here meant to be run before the update of the code path.

	% We thought that escript:script_name/0 was only meant to succeed if
	% executed from an escript, yet, if simply run from a module, it will still
	% succeed if at least an extra command-line line was specified.
	%
	% So escript:script_name() will fail if erl is launched with no option,
	% whereas it will succeed if launched with 'erl -extra foobar' for example.
	%
	% Currently we have no solution, and are not big fans of escripts, so in
	% (ambiguous) all cases we will consider we are not running from an escript.

% the same as the one used by shell_utils:get_argument_table/0 and is itself
% similar to the one used by Erlang for its user/system flags (i.e. for all its
% non-plain options).
%
% In this form, which by default is not available for escripts, options start
% with a dash, may have any number of arguments, and may be specified more than
% once in the command-line.
%
% Note: switches to the Unicode encoding (ex: use "~tp" then).
%
% Allows to write code that can be seamlessly triggered by a erl interpreter or
% by an escript, by putting them in the latter case in our "canonical" form.
