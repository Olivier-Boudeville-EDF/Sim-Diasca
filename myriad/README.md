# Ceylan-Myriad

![](/doc/myriad-title.png)

This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering all Erlang-based, all-purpose/generic base developments (formerly known as the 'Common' layer).

Please refer to the [Myriad official documentation](http://myriad.esperide.org), otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/Ceylan-Myriad/).

The 'master' branch is aimed to correspond to the current stable version of this layer.
