% Common definitions about bounding boxes.



% Record declarations:


% Circle-based 2D bounding box.
-record( circle, {

			% The center of the circle:
			center :: linear_2D:point(),

			% The square of the radius (R^2) of this circle:
			square_radius :: linear:square_distance()

} ).



% Right cuboid-based 3D bounding box (i.e. rectangular parallelepiped).
%
% Each of its faces is either parallel or orthogonal to each of the canonical
% axes.
%
% If base_vertex={X,Y,Z}, abscissa_length is A, ordinate_length is B,
% elevation_length is C, then cuboid is made of all points {Xp,Yp,Zp} where:
%
%  - X <= Xp < X + A
%
%  - Y <= Yp < X + B
%
%  - Z <= Zp < Z + C
%
%
% See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuboid
%
-record( right_cuboid, {

			% A vertex of the cuboid:
			base_vertex :: linear_3D:point(),

			% The length along the abscissa axis (X):
			abscissa_length :: linear:distance(),

			% The length along the ordinate axis (Y):
			ordinate_length :: linear:distance(),

			% The length along the elevation axis (Z):
			elevation_length :: linear:distance()
