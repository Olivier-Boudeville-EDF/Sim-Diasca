% The classical, canonical 3x3 matrix representation is:
%
%     | M11 M12 M13 |
% M = | M21 M22 M23 |
%     | M31 M32 M33 |
%
% This corresponds to this record specialised for 3D. Coordinates are listed row
% per row.
%
% A shorthand for these record and corresponding type could be m3.

-record( matrix3, {

  m11 :: linear:coordinate(),
  m12 :: linear:coordinate(),
  m13 :: linear:coordinate(),

  m21 :: linear:coordinate(),
  m22 :: linear:coordinate(),
  m23 :: linear:coordinate(),

  m31 :: linear:coordinate(),
  m32 :: linear:coordinate(),
  m33 :: linear:coordinate() } ).



% A 3x3 compact matrix is a 2x3 canonical matrix, or, said otherwise, a 2x2
% matrix M2 and a 2D vector T, as:
%
% M2 = | M11 M12 |
%      | M21 M22 |
%
% and T = transpose(| Tx Ty |).
%
% This corresponds to, by blocks:
%
% M = | M2 T |
%     |  0 1 |
%
%   = | M11 M12 Tx |
%     | M21 M22 Ty |
%     |   0   0  1 |
%
%
% Could have been, with more indirections, a {matrix2:matrix2(),
% vector2:vector2()} pair.
%
% A shorthand for these record and corresponding type could be cpt_m3.
