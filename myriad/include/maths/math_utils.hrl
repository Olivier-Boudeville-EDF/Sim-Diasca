% Numerical margin to account for rounding/quantisation errors induced by the
% use of floating-point numbers.
%
% For example, when using floating-point coordinates, equality of points is
% defined relatively to the epsilon distance: P1 is deemed equal to P2 iff the
% distance between P1 and P2 is below epsilon.
%
-define( epsilon, 1.0e-6 ).


% A threshold to denote unbounded values:
%
% (corresponds to the maximum value of 32-bit floats, i.e. the maximum
% representable IEEE 754 floating-point value)

-define( infinity, 3.402823e+38 ).
