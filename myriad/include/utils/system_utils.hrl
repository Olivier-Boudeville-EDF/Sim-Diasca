% The basic builtin shell commands and related executables (ex: cat, awk, grep,
% df) are not so easy to manage, as, from a distribution to another, they tend
% to sit in different locations (ex: /bin/, /usr/bin) and/or to be aliased or
% symlinked (ex: /usr/bin/awk being gawk). Depending also on the user
% environment, different conventions apply.
%
% These commands could be referred to directly as 'awk' or 'grep', yet it may be
% considered as a risk, with non-standard if not malicious executables being
% potentially thrown in a user's environment.
%
% Here we at least centralise the (unique) versions we prefer, and ensure that
% safer bet are done.
%
% Commands are unaliased; for example, '\\awk' is '\awk' once escaped; a
% backslash allows to unalias the corresponding command, to avoid
% not-so-compliant alternatives to be used.
%
% See https://www.tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/c1195.htm for more
% information.

-define( awk, " \\awk " ).

% "/bin/cat" should be valid as well:
-define( cat, " \\cat " ).

% "/bin/df" should be valid as well:

% "/bin/free" should be valid as well:
-define( free, " \\free " ).

% "/bin/grep" should be valid as well:
-define( grep, " \\grep " ).

-define( sed, " \\sed " ).

-define( id, " \\id " ).

-define( ulimit, " \\ulimit " ).


% For proper Unicode support (see also the comments in file_utils.erl).
%
% Note:
%
% - if ever setting a non-Unicode default encoding,
% system_utils:force_unicode_support/0 shall be modified
%
% - see the notes in the 'Regarding encodings and Unicode' section of the
% file_utils module, notably about the consequences of specifying an encoding at
% file opening
%
-define( default_encoding, utf8 ).


% Generally not to be used, as directly writing encoded content is safer and
% offers more control:

-define( default_encoding_opt, { encoding, ?default_encoding } ).
