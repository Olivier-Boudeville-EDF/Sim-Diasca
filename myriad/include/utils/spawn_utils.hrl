% Currently, by default we are in development mode, and we want as much
% information as possible, even at the expense of some performances, whereas in
% production mode the reciprocal is true.


% Tested in basic_utils_test.erl.


% Uncomment '#EXECUTION_TARGET := production' in GNUmakevars.inc to test:
-ifdef(exec_target_is_production).

  -define( myriad_spawn_info, "basic spawn" ).
  -define( myriad_spawn, spawn ).
  -define( myriad_spawn_link, spawn_link ).

-else.

  % In development mode then:

  % Currently disabled as leading to way too verbose error reports (ex: detailed
  % state of all neighbours):
  %
  %-define( myriad_spawn_info, "proc_lib spawn" ).
  %-define( myriad_spawn, proc_lib:spawn ).
  %-define( myriad_spawn_link, proc_lib:spawn_link ).

  % So currently basic as well:
  -define( myriad_spawn_info, "basic spawn" ).
  -define( myriad_spawn, spawn ).
  -define( myriad_spawn_link, spawn_link ).

-endif. % exec_target_is_production
