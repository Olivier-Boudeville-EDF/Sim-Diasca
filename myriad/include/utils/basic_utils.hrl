% Currently, by default we are in development mode, and we want as much
% information as possible, even at the expense of some performances, whereas in
% production mode the reciprocal is true.



% Uncomment '#EXECUTION_TARGET := production' in GNUmakevars.inc to test:


% Never both performs exports and definitions in a given include, otherwise
% sooner or later the 'attribute export after function definitions' compilation
% error will not be avoidable:
%
%-export([ get_execution_target/0 ]).



% @doc Returns the execution target this module (hence, probably, that layer as
% a whole) was compiled with, that is either the atom 'development' or
% 'production'.
%
% Dispatched in actual clauses, otherwise Dialyzer will detect an
% underspecification:
%
% -spec get_execution_target() -> execution_target().

-ifdef(exec_target_is_production).

-spec get_execution_target() -> 'production'.
get_execution_target() ->
	production.

-else. % exec_target_is_production

-spec get_execution_target() -> 'development'.
get_execution_target() ->
	development.

-endif. % exec_target_is_production
