% Header to export (internally to MyriadGUI) canvas-related defines.
%
% See gui_canvas.erl for the corresponding implementation.

% their blit/1 function is called.

	% Receives repaint, resize, etc. events:
	panel :: gui_panel:panel(),

	% Displayed area:
	bitmap :: gui_bitmap:bitmap(),

	% Actual place for rendering:
	back_buffer :: gui_render:back_buffer(),

	% As apparently we cannot retrieve the size of the underlying bitmap and

	%
	size :: gui:size() }).
