% @doc <b>GUI-Internal defines</b>, hence to be included solely by the gui
% subsystem, not by user code (as depends on wx).


% For wx records and all:
-include_lib("wx/include/wx.hrl").


% Some defines:

-define( any_id, ?wxID_ANY ).

-define( no_parent, wx:null() ).


% The special color that means "transparent" (i.e. no filling / a null alpha
% coordinate):
%
-define( transparent_color, ?wxTRANSPARENT_BRUSH ).



% A reference onto a GUI object, for the widgets that MyriadGUI added to the
% backend at hand.
%
% Results in terms such as: {myriad_object_ref, myr_canvas, _CanvasId=5}.
%
-record( myriad_object_ref, {

	% The type of GUI object referred to (ex: 'myr_canvas'):
	object_type :: gui:myriad_object_type(),

	% The identifier of this referenced instance:
	myriad_instance_id :: gui_id:myriad_instance_id() } ).

-type myriad_object_ref() :: #myriad_object_ref{}.
