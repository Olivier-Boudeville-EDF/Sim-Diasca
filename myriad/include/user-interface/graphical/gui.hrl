% Header to export MyriadGUI-related defines, both for user code and for
% internal one.
%
% See gui.erl for the corresponding implementation.


% Context sent to corresponding subscribers together with an event.
%
% This context can be ignored in most cases.

		   id :: gui:id(),


		   % Usually of no use, as such user data is a means of preserving a
		   % state, whereas the user event loop is better to do so:

		   user_data = [] :: gui:user_data(),


		   % The full, lower-level event (if any) resulting in our event:

		   % widget hierarchy)
		   %
		   backend_event = undefined :: maybe( gui:backend_event() )
