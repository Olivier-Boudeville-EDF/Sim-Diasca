% This header file gathers mostly following info records:
% - module_info
% - type_info
% - function_info



-type module_entry() ::
	basic_utils:maybe( { basic_utils:module_name(), ast_info:located_form() } ).
% Description of a module name.



% A record to store and centralise information gathered about an Erlang
% (compiled) module.
%
% Allows to perform checkings, and to reorder and transform the returned version
% of it.
%
% For that, ASTs and forms are used, in a located version of them, as the form
% order matters (to the actual compilation) and is a different, complementary
% information to the original in-file line and column numbers, which are kept
% for source reference purposes.
%
% We store the located forms verbatim whenever possible (depending on the case,
% either directly in the same field, or in *_def* counterpart fields), notably
% to preserve the line and column numbers within.
%
% In the former case, a single field (ex: 'module') contains a pair of
% information, whose first element is the higher level, syntax-free information
% that was gathered, and whose second element is a lower level, form-based,
% information (a bit more informative in terms of syntax and source layout, yet
% less tractable from a user point of view).
%
% In the latter case, there are thus two fields per theme:
%
% - the high-level, developer-friendly one (ex: 'compilation_options')
% - the raw one in AST form (ex: 'compilation_option_defs')
%
% It is up to the user to ensure that, if either field is modified, its
% counterpart one is updated accordingly. Note that there may not be a
% one-to-one mapping between the elements of two associated fields.

-record( module_info, {


		% Name (if any) of that module, together with its definition (as a
		% located form):
		%
		module = undefined :: module_entry(),



		% A table, whose keys are compilation options (ex: no_auto_import,
		% inline, etc.) and whose values are aggregated *lists* of their
		% associated values (ex: [{size,1}] and [{get_bucket_index,2},{f/1}]).
		%
		% Note:
		%
		% - for this aggregated, higher-level field, the specific way that was
		% used in order to specify these various information (ex: separately or
		% in groups, at which actual file locations, etc.) is abstracted out
		%
		% - options can also be specified through the command line with the -D
		% selector (ex: see ERLANG_COMPILER_TOKEN_OPT); as the in-source ones,
		% they are gathered in this table (yet do not have of course counterpart
		% forms in the compilation_option_defs field below); no specific
		% precedence between command-line options applies, as to a given option
		% name is associated a list of values (so they can be all aggregated in
		% that entry)
		%
		% - the 'inline' key is special-cased to account for its variants: if
		% full inlining is enabled ( '-compile( inline ).'), then its associated
		% key is not a list of function identifiers, but the 'all' atom
		%
		% - this field is to be kept in sync with its 'compilation_option_defs'
		% counterpart lower-level field
		%
		compilation_options :: ast_info:compile_option_table(),


		% The actual, lower-level definitions of the compilation options, like
		% in:
		%
		% [...]
		% {attribute,61,compile,{no_auto_import,[{size,1}]}},
		% {attribute,63,compile,{inline,[{get_bucket_index,2}]}},
		% {attribute,64,compile,{no_auto_import,[{foo,1},{bar,2}]}},
		% [...]
		%
		% Note: to be kept in sync with its 'compilation_options' counterpart
		% higher-level field
		%
		compilation_option_defs = [] :: [ ast_info:located_form() ],



		% Parse-level attributes (ex: '-my_attribute( my_value ).'), as a table
		% associating, to an attribute name (an atom key such as
		% 'my_attribute'), a list of pairs comprising each a value (ex:
		% my_value) and the corresponding AST form (knowing of course that a
		% given attribute name may be used multiple times).
		%
		% Such attributes, also named "wild attributes", mostly correspond to
		% user-defined ones (yet they include also for example 'behaviour'
		% attributes).
		%
		parse_attributes :: ast_info:attribute_table(),


		% Remote function specifications may be defined, like in:
		% -spec Mod:Name(...) -> ...
		%
		% Note: no counterpart field.
		%
		remote_spec_defs = [] :: [ ast_info:located_form() ],



		% Include files (typically *.hrl files).
		%
		% Unlike the raw definitions (in the 'include_defs' field), this field
		% does not include the filename of the module being compiled (ex:
		% "foobar.erl").
		%
		% (there is no duplicate either in that include list; we do not use a
		% set here though, as set_utils is not a bootstrapped module)
		%
		% Note: to be kept in sync with its 'include_defs' counterpart
		% lower-level field.
		%
		includes = [] :: [ file_utils:bin_file_path() ],


		% Include definitions:
		%
		% (possibly a given file might be included more than once; it is
		% generally the case for the module being currently compiled)

		% Note: to be kept in sync with its 'includes' counterpart higher-level
		% field.
		%
		include_defs = [] :: [ ast_info:located_form() ],



		% Whether a type (possibly any kind of it; ex: opaque or not) is
		% exported is stored primarily in its own type_info record (see the
		% 'types' field) through a list of locations, while the information
		% sufficient to reconstruct the actual forms for the exports of all
		% types are recorded here.
		%
		% Note: it is better that way, as a type export attribute may define any
		% number of exports, and we need to record the in-file location of its
		% definition.

		% Note: this field must be kept synchronised with the table in the
		% 'types' field.

		% lower-level field.

		% Whether a function (possibly any kind of it) is exported is recorded
		% primarily in its own function_info record through a list of locations,
		% while the information sufficient to reconstruct the actual forms for
		% the exports of all functions are recorded here.
		%
		% Note: it is better that way, as a function export attribute may define
		% any number of exports, and we need to record the in-file location of
		% its definition.
		%
		% As empty exports are allowed (i.e. '-export([]).'), by default at the
		% 'export_functions_marker' marker such an empty export is automatically
		% defined, so that the parse transforms are able to populate it whenever
		% they decide to introduce new functions that shall be exported.
		%
		% This field must be kept synchronised with the table in the 'functions'
		% field; note however that, should a function_info record there declare
		% among its locations (in its 'exported' field) the location of an
		% actual export form (typically the one of the previous marker) in this
		% current field (function_exports), the corresponding export will be
		% added here automatically, if not already defined.
