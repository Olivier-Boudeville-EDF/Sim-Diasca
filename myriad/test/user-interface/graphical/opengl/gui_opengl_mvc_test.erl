% @doc Testing of the <b>OpenGL support in a MVC setting</b>, evaluated
% concurrently at fixed, independent frequencies; in practice displays a
% textured rotating square.
%
% It is therefore a non-interactive, active test (the square is scheduled, so
% that it spontaneously rotates) whose main interest is to show a simple yet
% generic, appropriate structure in order to properly initialise the GUI and
% OpenGL, handle rendering, resizing and closing, and integrate a MVC-style
% (Model-View-Controller) parallel logic, with the model scheduling mostly
% uncoupled from the one of the rendering, i.e. a Model running in a different
% process from the View and from the test itself. This test being
% non-interactive, only a very basic controller exists, notably to listen to
% window-related events.
%
% This test relies on the OpenGL 1.x compatibility mode, as opposed to more
% modern versions of OpenGL (ex: 3.1) that rely on shaders and GLSL.
%
% See the gui_opengl.erl tested module and
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller for the
% MVC pattern.
