# package itself when creating an OTP application for it (see the
# rebar3-{create-tree, populate-build-tree, etc.} make targets) - except we
# directly work in from the application package root (ex: from
# "_build/default/lib/myriad") rather than from its vanilla source tree:


# Like the rebar3-create-tree target:
mkdir -p doc ebin include priv src test || exit 15

make -s all || exit 20

# Like the rebar3-copy-beams target:
find src -name '*.beam' -a ! -name '*_test.beam' -exec /bin/cp -f '{}' ebin/ ';' || exit 25

find src -name '*.hrl' -exec /bin/cp -f '{}' include/ ';' || exit 30

# Note that only the 'src' directory is available in an hex package; if the test
# sources are among the sources in 'src', they will be found, whereas if there
# is for example a 'tests' directory in the same directory as the 'src' one, it
# will not even be included in the hex package.
#

# OTP conventions:
/bin/cp -f src/${guessed_package_name}.app.src ebin/${guessed_package_name}.app || exit 40

# Hides the source files, otherwise rebar will attempt to recompile them (reason
# unclear) and fail:
