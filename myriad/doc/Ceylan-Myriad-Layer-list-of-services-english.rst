Services offered by the ``Myriad`` Layer
----------------------------------------


.. To update correctly:

The ``Myriad`` services are gathered into following themes:

#. General `build structure`_
#. General settings_
#. Maths_ services
#. `Data-management`_ services
#. Support for `code injection`_
#. Helpers for `graphical user interface`_ (GUI) programming
#. All-purpose `helper scripts`_
#. Spatial_ support
#. Utility toolbox_
#. Management of units_
#. Metaprogramming_, based on heavy use of parse transforms
#. `SQL support`_


In future versions of this document, following topics will be discussed:

- HDF5 support
- REST support
- third-party language bindings (ex: Python, Java, maybe in the future Haskell; C/C++ is to be tackled by our `Seaplus <http://seaplus.esperide.org>`_ project)
- RDF support

Even if this document does not constitute an exhaustive walk-through, each of them is detailed in turn below.

The next level of detail is either to browse the `Myriad API documentation <api-doc/index.html>`_ or simply to peer at the referenced `source files <https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad>`_, as they include many implementation notes, comments and typing information.
