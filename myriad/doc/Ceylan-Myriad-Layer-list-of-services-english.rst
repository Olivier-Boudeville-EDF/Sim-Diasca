Services offered by the ``Myriad`` Layer
----------------------------------------

The ``Myriad`` services are gathered into following themes:

#. General `build structure`_
#. General settings_
#. Maths_ services
#. `Data-management`_ services
#. Helpers for `graphical user interface`_ (GUI) programming
#. All-purpose `helper scripts`_
#. Utility toolbox_
#. Management of units_
#. Metaprogramming_, based on heavy use of parse transforms
#. `SQL support`_

In future versions of this document, following topics will be discussed:

- HDF5 support
- REST support
- third-party language bindings (ex: Python, Java, maybe in the future Haskell; C/C++ is to be tackled by our `Seaplus <http://seaplus.esperide.org>`_ project)
- RDF support

Even if this document does not constitute an exhaustive walk-through, each of them is detailed in turn below.

The next level of detail is to peer at the referenced source files, as they include many implementation notes, comments and typing information.
