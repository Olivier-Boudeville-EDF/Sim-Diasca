Support for ``Myriad``
======================

So you respected the prerequisites_ and build_ sections, and something went wrong? Generally we made sure that any detected error is blocking and loudly reported, with as much context as possible.

The simpler solution is then to `create a relevant issue <https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad/issues>`_.

For all other needs, please drop an email to the address listed on top of document. We do our best to answer on a timely basis.

Finally, provided that they meet licensing terms, scope and quality standards, contributions of all sorts are vey welcome, be them porting efforts, increased test coverage, functional enrichments, documentation improvements, code enhancements, etc. See the next section for additional guidelines.
