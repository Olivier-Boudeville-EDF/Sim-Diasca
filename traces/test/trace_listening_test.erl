% Unit tests for the implementation of trace listening.
%
% See the following modules:
%  - class_TraceListener
%  - class_TraceSupervisor
%  - class_TraceAggregator



% The mode of operation is to execute this test while the trace_mManagement_test
% is running:
% - run on a first terminal: 'make trace_management_run'
% - then run on a second terminal: 'make trace_listening_run'
%
% A new trace supervisor window should appear and allow to catch up all the past
% traces.
%
% One may check that the aggregator and the listener have exactly the same
% messages (ex: at least counts must match of both interfaces).
%
-module(trace_listening_test).


% For trace facilities:
-include("traces_for_tests.hrl").


% For trace_aggregator_name:
-include("class_TraceAggregator.hrl").



% Sends (as fast as possible) the specified number of traces:
send_traces( _Count=0 ) ->
	ok;

send_traces( Count ) ->
	?test_info_fmt( "Emitting trace  #~B from listener.", [ Count ] ),
	send_traces( Count - 1 ).



% Sends the specified number of traces with some waiting between sendings:
send_timed_traces( _Count=0 ) ->
	ok;

send_timed_traces( Count ) ->

	?test_info_fmt( "Emitting timed trace #~B from listener.", [ Count ] ),

	timer:sleep( 100 ),
