% @doc Test of the integration of the standard Erlang logs into the Traces
% subsystem.
%
-module(standard_trace_integration_test).



% Test target:
-include("traces_for_tests.hrl").



% @doc Runs the test.
%
% Sort of a counterpart of Myriad's trace_utils_test.erl.
%
% Not that if this test fails because it is not able to remove an handler, it
% might be the sign that some traces could not be properly sent. This should be
% displayed in the traces themselves.
