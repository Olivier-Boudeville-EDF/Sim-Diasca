% Testing of Traces as an OTP active application, directly from within its code
% base (hence without needing to create a separate, mock-up test OTP release for
% that).
%
-module(traces_otp_application_test).


% For run/0 export and al:
-include_lib("myriad/include/test_facilities.hrl").


% For TraceType:
-include("traces.hrl").


% Actual test:
test_traces_application( OrderedAppNames ) ->

	test_facilities:display( "Starting the Traces OTP active application." ),

	% We did not trap EXIT messages, as we wanted this test to crash (thanks to
	% the link below) in case of problem (and not to receive an EXIT message
	% bound not to be read).
	%
	% However this test was expected to crash (like its WOOPER counterpart) even
	% when stopping (normally) applications, as apparently an OTP application
	% has its child processes terminated with reason 'shutdown' (not 'normal');
	% no crash happened though (a difference between standard supervisors and
	% bridge ones?).
	%
	% So anyway now this test process traps EXIT messages, and ensures that none
	% besides {'EXIT',P,shutdown}, P being the PID of the trace aggregator, is
	% received.
	%
	false = erlang:process_flag( trap_exit, true ),

	otp_utils:start_applications( OrderedAppNames ),

	% Just to showcase that Traces is usable and running indeed:

	test_facilities:display( "Traces version: ~p.",
		[ system_utils:get_application_version( traces ) ] ),

	% As specified in *.config file(s):
	test_facilities:display( "Traces configuration settings: ~p.",
		[ application:get_all_env( traces ) ] ),


	AggPid =
		class_TraceAggregator:get_aggregator( _CreateIfNotAvailable=false ),


	% The top-level user process may not be aware that an OTP application fails
	% (ex: because its main process crashed), which is a problem for a test. So
	% here we link explicitly this test process to the trace aggregator, to
	% have a chance of detecting issues:
	%
	erlang:link( AggPid ),

	% Note that we did not link specifically to the WOOPER class manager.

	test_facilities:display( "Linked to the trace aggregator ~w.", [ AggPid ] ),


	% To test also a Traces module:

	class_TraceEmitter:send_from_test( notice, "Sent from this OTP test!" ),

	%traces:manage_supervision(),

	% Including Traces:
	test_facilities:display( "Stopping all user applications found in ~p.",
							 [ OrderedAppNames ] ),

	otp_utils:stop_user_applications( OrderedAppNames ),

	% Visibly no {'EXIT',AggPid,shutdown} message is to be expected here.

	% None expected to be left:
	basic_utils:check_no_pending_message(),

	test_facilities:display(
	  "Successful end of test of the Traces OTP application." ).



% Note that the traces.app, wooper.app and myriad.app files will have to be
% found and used for this test to succeed: Traces, WOOPER and Myriad must be
% already available as prerequisite, fully-built OTP applications.
%
-spec run() -> no_return().
run() ->

	test_facilities:start( ?MODULE ),

	% Build root directory from which sibling prerequisite applications may be
	% found:
	%
	BuildRootDir = "..",

	% No dependency (such as WOOPER or Myriad) specified in this test, yet they
	% are managed by otp_utils, based on the corresponding .app files:
	%
	OrderedAppNames = otp_utils:prepare_for_execution( _ThisApp=traces,
													   BuildRootDir ),

	trace_utils:notice_fmt( "Resulting applications to start, in order: ~w.",
							[ OrderedAppNames ] ),

	test_traces_application( OrderedAppNames ),

	test_facilities:stop().
