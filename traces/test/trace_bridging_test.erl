% Testing the <b>actual use of a trace bridge</b>, in the context of
% Ceylan-Traces.
%
% See also, in Ceylan-Myriad, trace_bridge_test.erl for a similar test when no
% specific bridge is registered.
%
-module(trace_bridging_test).


% Test target:
-include("traces_for_tests.hrl").


% @doc Runs the test.
-spec run() -> no_return().
run() ->

	?test_start,

	?test_info( "Testing first when no trace bridge is registered." ),

	% Note that we rely on the same test sending as the one done in Myriad, to
	% better showcase it can be transparently switched:
	%
	trace_bridge_test:emit_traces(),

	?test_info( "Then testing the trace bridge with a Ceylan-Traces bridge "
				"registered for this test process." ),

	% We define our own bridge spec and apply it to ourself:

	BridgeSpec = trace_bridge:get_bridge_spec( _MyEmitterName="MyBridgeTester",
		_MyCateg="MyTraceCategory", class_TraceAggregator:get_aggregator() ),

	trace_bridge:register( BridgeSpec ),

	trace_bridge:register_if_not_already( BridgeSpec ),

	trace_bridge_test:emit_traces(),

	trace_bridge:unregister(),

	?test_debug_fmt( "End of test for ~ts.", [ ?MODULE ] ),

	?test_stop.
