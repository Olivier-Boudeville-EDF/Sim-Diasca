% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-Traces can be directly
% tested separately (i.e. without needing to install upper layers, i.e. software
% depending on it): emulates a user of the Traces library.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.


% To be run through the 'test-hex-package' make target.

% Note that this testing relates just to the ability of bringing up the
% specified Traces version as a dependency; there is no actual test involved,
% i.e. no depending sources that would make use here of Traces.



% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.

% As an hex-package dependency:
%
% Implied:
% - {myriad, "MYRIAD_VERSION_FOR_REBAR"}
% - {wooper, "WOOPER_VERSION_FOR_REBAR" }
%
{deps, [ {traces, "VERSION_FOR_REBAR" } ] }.


% This testing just targets to trigger the build of Traces (and its Myriad and
% WOOPER dependencies), not of specific tests making use of it.

% Include directories found in INC:
{erl_opts, [ {d,myriad_debug_mode}, {d,wooper_debug_mode}, {d,traces_debug_mode}, {d,tracing_activated}, debug_info, {debug_info_key,"DEBUG_KEY_FOR_REBAR"}, report_warnings, warn_export_all, warn_export_vars, warn_shadow_vars, warn_obsolete_guards, warn_unused_import, warnings_as_errors, {parse_transform,wooper_parse_transform}, INCS_FOR_REBAR ]}.

{pre_hooks, [ {compile, "echo 'Traces testing pre-compile hook!'"} ]}.

{post_hooks, [
	{compile, "echo 'Traces testing post-compile hook!'"} ]}.



% For release generation:
%
% (defaults are for the development mode)
%
% With relx, only direct dependencies need to be listed, and version constraints
% can be used, instead of exact, specific versions.
%
% Probably that these releases are superfluous, in the sense that they are
% defined the same as the ones already included in WOOPER's
% rebar.config.template.
