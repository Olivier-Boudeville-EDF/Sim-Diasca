% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-Traces can better
% integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex, probably
% more flexible) native build based on GNU make.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% See the Myriad counterpart file (same name) for more explanations.


% Base layout was obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new app traces', as Traces is an
% active OTP application (not a mere library).

% To be taken into account, from the library root, through 'make
%  rebar3-application' or 'make rebar3-release'.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.


% Depends on the Ceylan-Myriad and Ceylan-WOOPER OTP library applications
% (Erlang implied):

% As GIT-based dependencies:
{deps, [ {myriad, {git, "git://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad",
					{branch, "master"}}},
		 {wooper, {git, "git://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-WOOPER",
					{branch, "master"}}} ] }.


% As an hex-package dependency:
%{deps, [ {wooper, "WOOPER_VERSION_FOR_REBAR"} ] }.


% Include directories found in INC:
{erl_opts, [ {d,myriad_debug_mode}, {d,wooper_debug_mode}, {d,traces_debug_mode}, {d,tracing_activated}, debug_info, {debug_info_key,"DEBUG_KEY_FOR_REBAR"}, report_warnings, warn_export_all, warn_export_vars, warn_shadow_vars, warn_obsolete_guards, warn_unused_import, warnings_as_errors, {parse_transform,wooper_parse_transform}, INCS_FOR_REBAR ]}.


% Bootstrapped modules (from BOOTSTRAP_MODULES):
%{erl_first_files, [ FIRST_FILES_FOR_REBAR ]}.


% (hooks needed, for example to create the include symlinks and for the build
% itself)
%
% Previously 'MYRIAD_REBAR_PROFILE=${REBAR_PROFILE}' was added, yet
% REBAR_PROFILE is actually not set, so we rely on our default value instead.
%
% Hooks had to be even strengthened, otherwise spurious, ill-configured
% compilations will be wrongly attempted by rebar3, when used as a dependency:
%
%{pre_hooks,  [ {compile, "make -s rebar3-compile-pre-hook"} ]}.
%{post_hooks, [ {compile, "make -s rebar3-compile-post-hook"} ]}.

{pre_hooks,  [ {compile, "make -s rebar3-bulletproof-compile-pre-hook"} ]}.
{post_hooks, [ {compile, "make -s rebar3-bulletproof-compile-post-hook"} ]}.


% For release generation:
%
% (defaults are for the development mode)
%
% With relx, only direct dependencies need to be listed, and version constraints
% can be used, instead of exact, specific versions.
