% Description of the Traces OTP active application, typically used by rebar3.

% Note: if this file is named traces.app, it is a *generated* file, whose real
% source is conf/traces.app.src, from which _build/lib/traces/ebin/traces.app is
% obtained and copied to ebin/traces.app; finally src/traces.app.src is a mere
% symlink to this last file, so we have:
%
% ./conf/traces.app.src [only real source]
% ./_build/lib/traces/ebin/traces.app
% ./ebin/traces.app
% ./src/traces.app.src -> ../ebin/traces.app
%
% For more information see the Ceylan-Myriad 'create-app-file' make target and
% its associated comments.
