% @doc This module gathers all the code that allows to <b>lighten the trace
% macros for (Myriad) applications</b>.

-module(traces_for_tests).


-export([ test_start/2, test_stop/3, test_immediate_stop/2,
		  test_stop_on_shell/2 ]).


-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "test.life-cycle" ).


% For test_info_fmt and al:
-include("traces_test_header.hrl").


% For TraceType:
-include("traces.hrl").


-include("class_TraceSupervisor.hrl").


-include("traces_test_footer.hrl").



% Shorthands:

-type module_name() :: basic_utils:module_name().

-type aggregator_pid() :: class_TraceAggregator:aggregator_pid().



% @doc Starts the specified test.
%
% To be called from the counterpart macro.
%
% The trace supervisor can be requested to be initialized now or not at all, or
% later (typically only once the desired filename for the traces file will be
% known for good, i.e. at its first renaming).
%
% Here we disable explicitly the trapping of EXIT signals, as a function run
% through "erl -eval" (like our apps) or through "erl -run" will be executed in
% a process that will silently trap EXIT signals, which would mean that the
% crash of any process created from the app, even thanks to spawn_link, would
% most probably remain unnoticed (just leading to an EXIT message happily
% sitting in the mailbox of the app process).
