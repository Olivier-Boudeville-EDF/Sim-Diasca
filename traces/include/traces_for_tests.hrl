% Defines some macros and functions useful for trace-using tests.
% This is thus the main/only header file such tests should include.


% We have kept macros for all the traces (including the ones for tests, and
% start/stop) for the sake of consistency. Moreover doing so allows to
% communicate more easily with agents like the trace aggregator (as we can then
% share discretly variables like TraceAggregatorPid).


% Defines everything regarding application traces:
-include("traces_test_header.hrl").


% For the export of run/0:
-include_lib("myriad/include/test_facilities.hrl").


% To avoid warnings if not used:
-export([ test_receive/0, test_receive/1, test_failed/1, test_failed/2 ]).


% For notify_* and al:
-include("traces.hrl").




% Start/stop section.
%
% Any test that is not using (directly on not) traces_for_tests:test_start/2
% (like with the macros below) should then execute by itself:
%
%    erlang:process_flag( trap_exit, false )
%
% otherwise the test will silently trap EXIT signals, typically resulting in
% having linked instances failing without notice.
%
% See the comment of traces_for_tests:test_start/2 for more details.


-ifdef(tracing_activated).


% TraceAggregatorPid voluntarily exported from test_start, for test_stop:

-define( test_start,

		 % true is for InitTraceSupervisor (not even binding a mute variable for
		 % that); test_stop/2 to be consistent with it.
		 %
		 TraceAggregatorPid = traces_for_tests:test_start( ?MODULE, true )
).


-define( test_stop,
		 % true is for WaitForTraceSupervisor, in accordance with test_start/2.
		 traces_for_tests:test_stop( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid, true )
).


-else. % tracing_activated


-define( test_start,
		 % Here, even if the trace sending is deactivated, a trace aggregator is
		 % created, as some processes nevertheless expect to find one at
		 % start-up, or some of them may have been recompiled to be
		 % trace-enabled.
		 %
		 % However no trace supervisor is needed here.
		 %
		 % false is for InitTraceSupervisor (not even binding a mute variable
		 % for that); test_stop/2 to be consistent with it.
		 %
		 TraceAggregatorPid = traces_for_tests:test_start( ?MODULE, false )
).


-define( test_stop,
		 % false is for WaitForTraceSupervisor, in accordance with test_start/2.
		 traces_for_tests:test_stop( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid, false )
).


-endif. % tracing_activated



% Valid whether or not tracing is activated:

-define( test_stop_without_waiting_for_trace_supervisor,
		 traces_for_tests:test_immediate_stop( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid )
).


-define( test_stop_on_shell,
		 traces_for_tests:test_stop_on_shell( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid )
).

% @doc Helper function to add receive clauses (for undiscriminated messages) in
% tests so that they cannot interfere with trace supervision, as a test may also
% receive trace control message that the test code should remain unware of.
%
% Returns the received value.
%
% Ex: Pid ! {getBaz, [], self()}, MyBaz = test_receive(), ...
%
% to be used instead of:
%
% Pid ! {getBaz, [], self()},
% receive
%
%   {wooper_result, V} ->
%			V

% end,
% ...
