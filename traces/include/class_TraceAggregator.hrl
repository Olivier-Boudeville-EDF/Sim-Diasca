% The name under which the trace aggregator process is to be registered:
% (use ?trace_aggregator_name to have it)
-define(trace_aggregator_name,ceylan_trace_aggregator).


% For TraceExtension:
% Should be already done: -include("traces.hrl").


% The name of the file to which the aggregator will write the traces it
% receives:
-define(trace_aggregator_filename,"Ceylan-traces" ++ ?TraceExtension ).


% The name of the (pseudo) module to rely on for the naming of the trace file
% produced by the trace aggregator, in an OTP-related application context.
%
-define( otp_application_module_name, traces_via_otp ).
