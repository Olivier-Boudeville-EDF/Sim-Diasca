% Defines some macros and functions useful for trace-using applications.
% This is thus the main/only header file such applications should include.


% We have kept macros for all the traces (including the ones for applications,
% and start/stop) for the sake of consistency. Moreover doing so allows to
% communicate more easily with agents like the trace aggregator (as we can then
% share discreetly variables like TraceAggregatorPid).


% Defines everything regarding application traces:
-include("traces_app_header.hrl").


% For the export of exec/0:
-include_lib("myriad/include/app_facilities.hrl").


% To avoid warnings if not used:
-export([ app_receive/0, app_receive/1, app_failed/1, app_failed/2 ]).


% For notify_* and al:
-include("traces.hrl").




% Start/stop section.
%
% Any application that is not using (directly on not)
% traces_for_apps:app_start/2 (like with the macros below) should then execute
% by itself:
%
%    erlang:process_flag( trap_exit, false )
%
% otherwise the application will silently trap EXIT signals, typically resulting
% in having linked instances failing without notice.
%
% See the comment of traces_for_apps:app_start/2 for more details.


-ifdef(tracing_activated).


% TraceAggregatorPid voluntarily exported from app_start, for app_stop:

-define( app_start,

		 % true is for InitTraceSupervisor (not even binding a mute variable for
		 % that); app_stop/2 to be consistent with it.
		 %
		 TraceAggregatorPid = traces_for_apps:app_start( ?MODULE, true )
).


-define( app_stop,
		 % true is for WaitForTraceSupervisor, in accordance with app_start/2.
		 traces_for_apps:app_stop( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid, true )
).


-else. % tracing_activated


% Here, even if the trace sending is deactivated, a trace aggregator is created,
% as some processes nevertheless expect to find one at start-up, or some of them
% may have been recompiled to be trace-enabled.
%
% However no trace supervisor is needed here.
%
-define( app_start,

		 % false is for InitTraceSupervisor (not even binding a mute variable
		 % for that); app_stop/2 to be consistent with it.
		 %
		 TraceAggregatorPid = traces_for_apps:app_start( ?MODULE, false ) ).



-define( app_stop,
		 % false is for WaitForTraceSupervisor, in accordance with app_start/2.
		 traces_for_apps:app_immediate_stop( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid,
											 false )
).


-endif. % tracing_activated



% Valid whether or not tracing is activated:

-define( app_stop_without_waiting_for_trace_supervisor,
		 traces_for_apps:app_immediate_stop( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid )
).


-define( app_stop_on_shell,
		 traces_for_apps:app_stop_on_shell( ?MODULE, TraceAggregatorPid )
).

% Defines everything regarding application traces:
-include("traces_app_footer.hrl").



% Helper function to write receive clauses in applications which cannot
% interfere with trace supervision, as an application may also receive trace
% control message the application code should remain unware of.
%
% Returns the received value.
%
% Ex: Pid ! { getBaz, [], self() }, MyBaz = app_receive(), ...
%
% to be used instead of:
%
% Pid ! { getBaz, [], self() },
% receive
%
%   { wooper_result, V } ->
%			V
%
% end,
% ...
%
-spec app_receive() -> any().
app_receive() ->
	traces:receive_applicative_message().


% Helper function to write receive clauses for specific messages in applications
% while not interfering with trace supervision.
%
-spec app_receive( any() ) -> void().
app_receive( Message ) ->
	traces:receive_applicative_message( Message ).




% Helper macro for those who would not know they could have called the
% corresponding function directly:
%
-define( app_failed, app_failed() ).



% Handles an application failure, using specified string as advertised reason.
-spec app_failed( text_utils:ustring() ) -> no_return().
app_failed( Reason ) ->

	% For some reason erlang:error is unable to interpret strings as strings,
	% they are always output as unreadable lists.

	Message = text_utils:format( "Application ~ts failed, reason: ~ts.",
								 [ ?MODULE, Reason ] ),

	trace_utils:error( Message ),

	?app_emergency( Message ),

	% Needed, otherwise error_logger may not display anything:
	system_utils:await_output_completion(),

	erlang:error( "Application ~ts failed.", [ ?MODULE ] ).



% Handles an application failure, using specified first string as an advertised
% reason with format characters (ex: '~w') and specified list as actual values
% to be formatted.
%
-spec app_failed( text_utils:format_string(), text_utils:format_values() ) ->
							no_return().
app_failed( FormatReason, FormatValues ) ->
	app_failed( text_utils:format( FormatReason, FormatValues ) ).
