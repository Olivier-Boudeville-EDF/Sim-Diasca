% Defines all the macros and exports useful for trace-using applications.
%
% Allows to define exports before functions: macros and functions have been
% split so that overall header files can be defined which start with all macros
% and finish with all function definitions.



% Define functions as late as possible.
%
% app_trace_disabled/{1,2} must be defined whether or not traces are enabled
% (as void traces use them in all cases), but then they might be reported as
% unused (depending on the user code).
%
% Hence this report is silenced here in all cases:


-compile( [ { nowarn_unused_function, [ { app_trace_disabled, 1 },
										{ app_trace_disabled, 2 } ] } ] ).


-spec app_trace_disabled( any() ) -> void().
app_trace_disabled( _ ) ->
	ok.


-spec app_trace_disabled( any(), any() ) -> void().
app_trace_disabled( _, _ ) ->
	ok.
