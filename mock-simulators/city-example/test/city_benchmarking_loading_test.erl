% The purpose of this module is to load and start a simulation from the full
% description of the initial state of a city, as stored in file by the
% counterpart generation module.
%
% See the city_benchmarking_generation_test.erl to generate such a
% initialisation file.



% This is useful for larger cases like this one, as the procedural generation
% might be very long: better generate the initial state once for all, and re-use
% it at will in various simulation instances.



% Example of intended use:
%
% make city_benchmarking_loading_run CMD_LINE_OPT="--batch --duration long
% --scale huge"
%
-module(city_benchmarking_loading_test).


% Launchers specific to this case, for a run made from the shell:
-export([ run/2 ]).


% For ?gis_name:
-include("class_GIS.hrl").


% For ?city_example_version:
-include("city_example_version.hrl").


% For facilities common to all cases:
-include("sim_diasca_for_cases.hrl").


% For the city_description record:
-include("class_CityGenerator.hrl").



% Implementation notes:
%
% See get_benchmark_settings/0 to dimension your test.
%
% Typically to be run non-interactively (batch mode, with no trace supervisor),
% potentially with all traces disabled and all settings chosen for production
% rather than development.
%
% This should translate into having the user:
%
% - rebuild everything accordingly, from the Sim-Diasca root directory: 'make
% clean all EXECUTION_TARGET=production'
%
% - run this benchmarking case generator, from its directory: 'make
% city_benchmarking_loading_run CMD_LINE_OPT="--batch --duration long --scale
% huge" EXECUTION_TARGET=production';




% Runs the test, determining the settings from the command-line, otherwise using
% defaults.
