% Gathering of common settings, applicable to all models of the City-example
% case.


% For benchmarking reasons, we need here to relax the checkings done by the
% engine as this particular road network may generate shorter roads leading to
% smaller durations, themselves leading to too high rounding errors when
% performing time conversions.


% We choose on purpose an abnormally high threshold before an error is
% triggered, as we want to avoid that, due to the procedural generation, the
% simulation fails at any given scale:
%
-define( city_max_relative_error, 0.5 ).


% Length of the edge of a weather cell, in meters:
-define( weather_cell_length, 2400 ).
