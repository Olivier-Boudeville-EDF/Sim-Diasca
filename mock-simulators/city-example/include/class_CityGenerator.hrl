% Description of a city that is to be procedurally created.
%
% The city is defined into a 3D cartesian system (orthonormal basis).
%
% The earth is assumed locally plane, a {X,Y,Z} coordinate uses Z as its
% elevation relative to the left-most (smallest X), nearest (smallest Y), lower
% (smallest Z) point of the corresponding right cuboid.

	% Vector from the origin of the coordinate system to the center of the
	% right cuboid corresponding to the city:

	% Dimensions of the city {XLen, YLen, ZLen} in its local referential (which
	% is the absolute referential translated by the center vector): extent of
	% the city (which is a contained into a right_cuboid bounding box), from the
	% origin and alongside the three canonical axes, specified thanks to the
	% point opposite to the origin:

	incinerator_count :: basic_utils:count(),

	residential_waste_source_count :: basic_utils:count(),

	industrial_waste_source_count :: basic_utils:count(),


	% The number of road junctions in the city:
	road_junction_count :: basic_utils:count(),


	% The number of waste trucks operating in the city:
