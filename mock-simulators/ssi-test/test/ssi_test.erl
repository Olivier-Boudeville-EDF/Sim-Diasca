% SSI-test stands for 'Sim-Diasca Scalability Integration Test', a business-free
% test dedicated to scalability assessment.

% This is one of the test cases of the Mock Simulators, used to emulate a
% third-party set of simulation cases and models that are to form with the
% Sim-Diasca engine a full-blown simulator: we test the ability of the engine to
% integrate approriately any user code.

% Aiming at showing and testing all main sim-diasca features, a simplified
% forest ecosystem context is designed. This ecosystem is composed of the
% following components:

% - class_Forest.erl
% - class_ForestDweller.erl
% - class_Oak.erl
% - class_Squirrel.erl
% - class_FemaleRedSquirrel.erl
% - class_MaleRedSquirrel.erl



% @doc This test shows:
%
% - the different ways for actor creation:
%
%  - initial actor creation: an actor created before simulation starting (see
%  initial squirrel instance creation in class_Forest.erl)
%
%  - initial placed actor creation: an actor created with a place hint before
%     simulation starting (see initial oak instance creation in class_Forest)
%
%  - placed actor creation in run time, i.e during the simulation (see female
%  and male squirrel creation in class_FemaleRedSquirrel.erl)
%
% - the different scheduling modes for actor spontaneous activities:
%
%   - in periodic way: see class_forest instance
%
%   - in passive way: see class_oak instance
%
%   - in mix way: see class_FemaleRedSquirrel and class_MaleRedSquirrel.erl
%   instance
%
% - the different ways for probe creation:
%
%   - create probe by class_Probe.erl and save the data in plain text
%
%   - create probe (or rather virtual probe) via class_DataLogger.erl and save
%   data in mnesia with setData by sending wooper message and setData directly
%   in probe table by calling dataLogger static method
%
% - the actor communication
%
% - the scalable capacity by parametering the forest dweller number, longevity
% of the dweller and the simulation duration time
%
