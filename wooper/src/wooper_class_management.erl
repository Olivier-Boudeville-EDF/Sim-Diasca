-module(wooper_class_management).


-export([ check_classname/1, manage_classname/2, manage_superclasses/1 ]).



% For the function_info record:
-include_lib("myriad/include/ast_info.hrl").

% For the class_info record:
-include("wooper_info.hrl").


% Shorthands:

-type class_info() :: wooper_info:class_info().




% Implementation notes:

% The implementation of getClassname/1 might be created here rather than being
% defined in the wooper_classes_functions.hrl header file.


% Regarding WOOPER superclasses.
%
% They used to be defined with:
% '-define(wooper_superclasses, [class_A, class_B]).'.
%
% Now they are either defined with the optional:
%
% '-superclasses([class_A, class_B]).
%
% (which has been finally preferred to '-wooper_superclasses([]).').
%
% or with the alternative (optional as well):
% '-define(superclasses, [class_A, class_B]).'
%
% This latter form is less interesting than the former, yet it allows to follow
% the same convention as '-define( class_attributes, [...])', which is more
% constrained (due to the parentheses involved in a type declaration, it cannot
% be a wild attribute like -attributes or -class_attributes).
%
% So either method is supported (of course up to only one of them should be,
% knowing that, if -superclasses is used, no -define will be searched for), and
% the -define method is the recommended one, for homogeneity reasons.


% @doc Ensures that specified name is a legit class name, and returns it.
