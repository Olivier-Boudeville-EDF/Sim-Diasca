% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-WOOPER can be directly
% tested separately (i.e. without needing to install upper layers, i.e. software
% depending on it): emulates a user of the WOOPER library.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.


% To be run through the 'test-hex-package' make target.

% Note that this testing relates just to the ability of bringing up the
% specified WOOPER version as a dependency; there is no actual test involved,
% i.e. no depending sources that would make use here of WOOPER.



% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.

% As an hex-package dependency:
%
% Implied: {myriad, "MYRIAD_VERSION_FOR_OTP"}
%
{deps, [ {wooper, "VERSION_FOR_OTP" } ] }.


% This testing just targets to trigger the build of WOOPER (and its Myriad
% dependency), not of specific tests making use of it.

% For release generation:
%
% (defaults are for the development mode)
%
% With relx, only direct dependencies need to be listed, and version constraints
% can be used, instead of exact, specific versions.
%
% Probably that these releases are superfluous, in the sense that they are
% defined the same as the ones already included in WOOPER's
% rebar.config.template.
