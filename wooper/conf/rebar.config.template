% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-WOOPER can better
% integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex, probably
% more flexible) native build based on GNU make.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% See the Myriad counterpart file (same name) for more explanations.


% Base layout was obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new app wooper', as WOOPER is an
% active OTP application (not a mere library).

% To be taken into account, from the library root, through 'make
%  rebar3-application' or 'make rebar3-release'.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.


% Depends on the Ceylan-Myriad OTP library application (Erlang implied):

% As a GIT-based dependency:
{deps, [ {myriad, {git, "git://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan-Myriad",
					{branch, "master"}}} ] }.


% As an hex-package dependency:
%
% (works if the package uses a specific hook script, see
% hex-compile-hook-script.sh, to compensate for the GNUmake* root files that the
% package archive will not include at their location)
%
%{deps, [ {myriad, "MYRIAD_VERSION_FOR_REBAR"} ] }.


% Include directories found in INC:

% Bootstrapped modules (from BOOTSTRAP_MODULES):
{erl_first_files, [ FIRST_FILES_FOR_REBAR ]}.


% (hooks needed, for example to create the include symlinks and for the build
% itself)
%
% Previously 'MYRIAD_REBAR_PROFILE=${REBAR_PROFILE}' was added, yet
% REBAR_PROFILE is actually not set, so we rely on our default value instead.
