% Description of the WOOPER OTP active application, typically used by rebar3.

% Note: if this file is named wooper.app, it is a *generated* file, whose real
% source is conf/wooper.app.src, from which _build/lib/wooper/ebin/wooper.app is
% obtained and copied to ebin/wooper.app; finally src/wooper.app.src is a mere
% symlink to this last file, so we have:
%
% ./conf/wooper.app.src [only real source]
% ./_build/lib/wooper/ebin/wooper.app
% ./ebin/wooper.app
% ./src/wooper.app.src -> ../ebin/wooper.app
%
% For more information see the Ceylan-Myriad 'create-app-file' make
% target and its associated comments.
