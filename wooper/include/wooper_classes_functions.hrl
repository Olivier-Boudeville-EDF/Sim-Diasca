% Modular WOOPER header gathering the class-related primitives (function
% definitions).


% Note: functions below (ex: getClassname/1) are "verbatim" methods: rather than
% being generated through a parse-transform (which would bring no added value),
% it is actually more convenient to inject their code thanks to a header file.
% However these verbatim methods shall not be considered as built-in, as we want
% to have them registered (known of the WOOPER parse transforms) as methods (ex:
% so that they are themselves transformed, since they use method terminators).


% @doc Request returning the classname of the instance.
%
% Always accurate, in all constructors, methods and destructors.
%
-spec getClassname( wooper:state() ) -> const_request_return( classname() ).
getClassname( State ) ->
	wooper:const_return_result( State#state_holder.actual_class ).



% @doc Request returning the (direct) superclasses of the instance.
%
% Always accurate, in all constructors, methods and destructors.
%
-spec getSuperclasses( wooper:state() ) ->
								const_request_return( [ classname() ] ).
getSuperclasses( State ) ->
	ActualModule = State#state_holder.actual_class,
	SuperClasses = ActualModule:get_superclasses(),
	wooper:const_return_result( SuperClasses ).



-ifdef(wooper_debug_mode).


% @doc Returns a full textual description of this instance, including its state
% and virtual table.
%
% This is a method for debug purpose, only activated if wooper_debug_mode is
% defined.
