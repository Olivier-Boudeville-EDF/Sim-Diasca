% Modular WOOPER header gathering the facilities for instance destruction.


% Debug or not:
-spec wooper_destruct( wooper:state() ) -> wooper:state().


-ifdef(wooper_debug_mode).


% @doc Calls recursively the destructors through the inheritance tree.
%
% Each destructor (destruct/1 function) is purely local to the current module.
%
% Initial specified state is always valid (comes from the main loop), but states
% returned by user-defined destructors must be checked in debug mode.

	% If a class-specific destruct/1 is defined, executes it, otherwise does

	% in the method table would be more efficient, see
	% wooper_class_manager:get_virtual_table_key_for):

	% always return the leaf class. We use ?MODULE (even for embodied
