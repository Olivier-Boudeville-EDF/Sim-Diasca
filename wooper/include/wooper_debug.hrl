% Uncomment to enable WOOPER-level traces:
%-define( enable_wooper_traces, ).


-ifdef(enable_wooper_traces).

% To avoid variables being reported as unused depending on the mode:

 -define( display_trace( S ),
		  basic_utils:ignore_unused( { wooper_trace_disabled, S } ) ).

 -define( display_trace( S, F ),
		  basic_utils:ignore_unused({ wooper_trace_disabled, S, F } ) ).
