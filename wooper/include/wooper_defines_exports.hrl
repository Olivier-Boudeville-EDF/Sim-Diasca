% Modular WOOPER header gathering all general-purposes defines.


% Note: types are defined here but exported in wooper.erl.



% Note: the hashtable type used by WOOPER (not the one exposed as a potential
% attribute) should be a preprocessor define
%
-define( wooper_table_type, table ).


% Approximate average attribute count for a given class instance, including
% inherited ones (ideally should be slightly above the maximum number of actual
% attributes for a given class)
%
-define( wooper_attribute_count_upper_bound, 16 ).


% Tells whether the OTP integration of WOOPER (involving supervisor, gen_server,
% explicit starting, etc.) shall be enabled.
%
-define( wooper_enable_otp_integration, true ).
%-define( wooper_enable_otp_integration, false ).


% Number of milliseconds to wait for, in order to be reasonably sure that the
% warning message could be written to the console, knowing that the operation is
% asynchronous and thus may not be performed should the VM halt immediately:
%
% (otherwise you will not see any stacktrace)
%
-define( wooper_warning_display_waiting, 200 ).


% Number of milliseconds to wait for, in order to be reasonably sure that the
% error message could be written to the console, knowing that the operation is

-define( wooper_error_display_waiting, 500 ).




% Records the state of an instance.
% Module is the Erlang module the class is mapped to.
%
% This is the class-specific object state, each instance of this class will have
% its own state_holder, quite similar to the 'C++' this pointer.
%
% Constant data (ex: the virtual table) are referenced by each class instance,
% they are not duplicated (pointer to a virtual table shared by all class
% instances rather than deep copy).
%
% The virtual table holds the method name to module mapping for a given class.
% The attribute table (a hashtable) records all the data members of a given
% instance, including all the inherited ones.
%
% The request sender member is used internally by WOOPER so that a request
% method have a way of retrieving the corresponding caller PID. This avoids the
% caller to specify its PID twice, one for WOOPER, one for the method, as a
% method parameter, in the case the method itself needs the caller PID, for
% example to register it in a list in its own state. Thus a caller does not have
% to specify: 'MyInstance ! {my_request,[self()],self()}', specifying
% 'MyInstance ! {my_request,[],self()}' is enough: the method will be able to
% retrieve the caller PID thanks to the request_sender member, automatically set
% by WOOPER. For non-request methods (oneways), WOOPER will set request_sender
% to the atom 'undefined', to ensure the oneway crashes whenever trying to use
% this request-specific information to send a message.
%
% Therefore when you see the first parameter of a method, 'State', it is
% actually just an instance of the following record:
%
-record( state_holder, {

		   %virtual_table :: maybe( ?wooper_table_type:?wooper_table_type() ),

		   % Just a key in the persistent_term registry:
		   %virtual_table_key :: wooper:class_key(),

		   % Now directly a reference within the persistent_term registry:
		   virtual_table :: ?wooper_table_type:?wooper_table_type(),

		   attribute_table :: maybe( ?wooper_table_type:?wooper_table_type() ),

		   % Only means that we know to access the actual class name:
		   %
		   % (otherwise we could not, for example, report in an intermediate
		   % child class the actual class name of a deleted instance)
		   %
		   % To be used, instead of ?MODULE or alike.
		   %
		   actual_class :: basic_utils:module_name(),

		   request_sender :: maybe( pid() )

}).



% Now that type-checking on the state record is performed in debug mode, in both
% modes method results are sent directly:
%
% (no wooper_result atom added any more in debug mode)
%
%-define( wooper_return_state_result( State, Result ), { State, Result } ).
%-define( wooper_return_state( State ), State ).
%
% Finally, using retrocompatibility macros, resulting in the same code:
%
% (retrocompatibility now shall have been solved, hence these macros are
% disabled)
%
%-define( wooper_return_state_result( S, R ),
%		 wooper:return_state_result( (S), (R) ) ).

%-define( wooper_return_state( S ), wooper:return_state( (S) ) ).
