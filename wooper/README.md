This repository corresponds to the part of the [Ceylan project](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Ceylan) gathering all WOOPER-related elements, for Object-oriented programming in Erlang.

Please refer to the [WOOPER official documentation](http://wooper.esperide.org), otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/Ceylan-WOOPER/).

The 'master' branch is aimed to correspond to the current stable version of this layer.
