# Sim-Diasca

## Purpose of this repository

This is the official repository of the Sim-Diasca simulation engine, which is developed and released by [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/inventing-the-future-of-energy/r-d-global-expertise).

Note that this repository is currently not operational yet (work in progress). It is to complement the [main official page](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/world-s-largest-power-company/activities/research-and-development/scientific-communities/simulation-softwares?logiciel=10832) of Sim-Diasca.


## Sim-Diasca in a nutshell

Sim-Diasca (*Simulation of Discrete Systems of All Scales*) is a discrete-time simulation engine aiming for maximum concurrency, relying on a mode of operation that is both parallel and distributed.

Sim-Diasca focuses notably on scalability, in order to handle simulation cases which may be very large (potentially involving millions of interacting instances of models), while still preserving essential simulation properties, like causality, total reproducibility and some kind of ergodicity.

The simulation engine is implemented in the Erlang language and its execution platform of choice is GNU/Linux.

It is developed by EDF R&D and is released under the LGPL licence.

For more information, please refer to the *Sim-Diasca Technical Manual*.

Until the various elements are available online, please [contact us](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/world-s-largest-power-company/activities/research-and-development/scientific-communities/simulation-softwares?logiciel=10832) for an archived copy of the last stable version and its related documentation.
